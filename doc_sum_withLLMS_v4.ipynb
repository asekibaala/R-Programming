Introduction\\n\\n\\nThe police-involved deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other Black Americans led many to critically reappraise the role of police in society. These focusing events gave rise to widespread calls for reforms to diminish systemic racism and the role of law enforcement in American society by reducing local police budgets and reallocating those resources toward civilian agencies (Lum, Koper, &amp; Wu 2022). Amid increased attention to violent crime nationally (Brennan 2022; Goodman 2021), policymakers seek reforms to shift police resources toward crime control and prevention (Parker &amp; Hurst 2021).\\n\\nEmpirical evidence supports both sides of this duality by demonstrating that expanded police presence (supported by increased spending) can reduce crime while also amplifying tension between communities of color and police. This conundrum speaks to the pressing need to understand the implications of police spending as well as how police budgets and resources are allocated. Recent analyses suggest U.S. cities consistently under-invest in policing relative to the crime-reducing potential of additional police (Chalfin &amp; McCrary 2018). There are also considerably fewer U.S. police officers per homicide compared to other high- and mediumincome countries (Lewis &amp; Usmani 2022). Mello (2019) estimates the marginal social benefit of hiring an additional police officer exceeds $300,000 annually. While there may be tangible benefits to crime control associated with investing in police, the actions of police officers can also impose harm on communities, especially predominantly Black communities (Soss &amp; Weaver, 2017). For example, police are more likely to use force in interactions with Blacks than with whites (Edwards, Esposito, &amp; Lee 2019; Fryer 2019; Knox, Lowe, &amp; Mummolo 2020; Hoekstra &amp; Sloan 2022). Black residents also report less satisfaction with police, more legal cynicism, and are more likely to believe that police act unjustly (Hagan et al., 2005; Pickett et al., 2021; Sampson &amp; Bartusch, 1998; Weitzer et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2009).\\n\\nOne potential pathway to reducing harm associated with police presence while preserving or even enhancing public safety is to limit unnecessary interactions between police and community members by diverting certain calls for service to civilian responders.  From this 1 perspective, re-tasking police emergency service calls that are outside the scope of crime control and prevention (that is, do not require an armed law enforcement officer with broad coercive\\n\\npowers) to civilian agencies should reduce police misuse of force in the United States. Indeed, the presence of an armed officer can worsen some situations; individuals with behavioral health problems may see armed officer as a threat, not a source of security.\\n\\nReforms to emergency responses could yield other benefits. For example, they have the potential to free police officer time to focus on serious crime which may also yield improvements with community satisfaction in police. In fact, recent studies estimate that 40 to 70 percent of community-initiated emergency calls for service do not involve a criminal incident (Brantingham &amp; Uchida 2021; Lum, Koper, &amp; Wu 2022; Neusteter et al. 2020; Ratcliffe 2021). Further, given that police officers may be costlier to deploy than other first responders, efficiency gains may accrue where calls for service are unlikely to require police presence. These funds could be diverted to other community agencies or services that could 'step in' to respond to nonemergency situations.\\n\\nIn this study we consider the viability of re-tasking a subset of police emergency calls to civilian first responders in Baltimore, Maryland. We then identify the implications of retasking using two related measures: police time use and the financial cost of police. We estimate both outcomes using Monte Carlo simulation methods to account for uncertainty in the components of the call dispatch and response process. Our approach is based on the police service costing method proposed by Ellingwood (2016) that assigns the financial cost of each emergency call for service based on time use reported by officers and the wages of uniformed officers or civilian responders such as an Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) or social workers. The baseline analysis shows that calls that are already re-tasked by several 'early adopter' municipalities could be resolved by civilian responders while freeing the equivalent of 59 officers' labor time annually (95% confidence interval: 43 - 75 officers) in Baltimore with minimal impact on public safety expenditure. The middle estimate represents about 9 percent of the Department's current patrol officers.\\n\\nOur findings build on prior work by investigating the relative risks and costs of emergency public safety response in a major U.S. city. This paper is also the first to present a model to evaluate the time use and fiscal consequences of program design alternatives for 911 call diversion to civilian first responders. We demonstrate that the model can be adapted to varying re-tasking regimes to suit jurisdictions' varying conditions and preferences. Based on administrative data from Baltimore, we further show that the calls diverted in existing programs\\n\\noperated by other large U.S. cities are conservative in terms of risk of serious crime, but relatively lax in terms of patrol officers' perceived need for police response. However, the underlying purpose of this paper is to provide a data-driven model through which re-tasking decisions can be evaluated, not to prescribe which calls should be re-tasked.\\n\\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant literature on civil-police relations, dispatching, and police retasking. Section 3 describes qualitative data obtained through interviews with and on-site observation of three large urban police jurisdictions that adopted 911 call diversion programs. Section 4 summarizes the data and methods used to evaluate the risk of emergency calls for service and the potential for transition. Section 5 reports the findings of this analysis. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for Baltimore and U.S. cities broadly.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Background\\n\\n\\nThe deaths of many Black Americans in police custody inspired a wave of mass protests in the summer of 2020. A subset of these protesters demanded local governments 'defund' their police departments. These calls quickly grew to a broader set of criticisms about the role of police in American society encompassing their responsibilities, practices, and funding. This section assesses relevant literature on police funding, force size, crime, and civil-police relations with minority communities. Social upheaval and calls for reform provide a window of opportunity for police reforms aimed at reducing the role of police in non-criminal emergency events. These reforms have the potential to decrease the incidence of police violence while freeing police resources that could be reallocated to crime control or other priorities.\\n\\nSeveral studies find race is an important correlate of municipal police spending and that police forces grow with the proportion of the minority population in the community (Holmes et al. 2008; McCarty, Ren, &amp; Zhao 2012). Notably, McCarty et al. (2012) show police strength as measured by budgetary resources is strongly positively related to the share of African American residents in a municipality and weakly to the crime rate. Beck and Goldstein (2018) find that police budgets grew in recent decades even as crime declined because municipalities increasingly rely on police to address social problems in lieu of traditional social service providers.\\n\\nA growing academic literature considers the intersection of policing and race. Owens (2020) notes that extant literature that estimates the benefits of police in reducing crime or the fiscal cost of criminal justice administration has largely ignored 'the impact that police actions can have on the legitimacy of law enforcement and credibility of the state as a benevolent social planner' (p. 11). Recent empirical evidence by Chalfin et al. (2022) recognizes the differential impact of policing among racial groups within a community. They find additional police deter homicides and that the benefit is twice as large for Black Americans compared to whites. However, additional police also means more arrests for minor offenses, and these arrests disproportionately fall on Black Americans without any clear benefit in terms of reduction in criminal harms.  Further, Knox et al. (2020) and Hoekstra and Sloan (2022) separately find 2 Black and Latine people are more likely to experience force than whites during police encounters in studies of large U.S. cities.  Police use of force incidents can also have a chilling effect on 3 public safety and other social outcomes. For example, Cheng and Long (2022) find that highly publicized police killings reduced subsequent proactive policing activities and arrests in several U.S. cities between 2014 and 2016. On the other hand, Moyer (2021) finds community-initiated emergency calls for service in Baltimore were not impacted by the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody in 2015. Several studies suggest that loss of trust in police can reduce the willingness to report crimes (Rosenfeld et al. 2003, Carr et al. 2007, Slocum et al 2010, Tyler &amp; Fagan 2008), though some other papers do not find evidence of this relationship (Frank et al. 1996, Davis &amp; Henderson 2003).\\n\\nA new literature emphasizes the role of emergency communication centers in shaping police interactions, including those with the potential to result in use of force.  Lum et al. (2020) 4 finds that emergency calltakers resolve a substantial percentage of calls for service without direct police involvement. However, call centers are typically required to dispatch police if certain conditions are met, and about half of non-violent calls reviewed by Lum et al. (2020) received a police dispatch. Gillooly (2020) shows that calltakers' risk appraisals prime responding officers' responses to incidents. Other research suggests that calltakers and dispatchers are often poorly\\n\\nequipped to make these assessments. For example, the Pew Charitable Trusts (2021) found less than half of emergency communication centers provided behavioral health crisis training to identify high priority calls. The emerging research suggests successful re-tasking efforts require calltakers and dispatchers to accurately identify calls for service that may be resolved by civilians. It also raises the possibility that certain emergency calls may be systematically misidentified as eligible for a civilian response when police are required. We address this concern in our empirical analysis.\\n\\nIn summary, the extant academic literature reaches remarkable and problematic conclusions about policing, crime, and race. Police funding is associated with the racial composition of a municipality, and thus marginalized communities are more heavily policed than predominately white communities even if the underlying crime rates are comparable. The evidence of the direct effects and externalities of intensive policing is mixed, with recent studies suggesting that it delivers some benefits but also disproportionate costs to Black residents. Owens (2020) argues over-policing of these communities damages the legitimacy of the police, and, in turn, may erode legal compliance in the community (Papachristos, Meares, &amp; Fagan 2012; Tyler, Jackson, &amp; Mantovich 2015).\\n\\nAdvocates of police reform argue that transitioning police service calls to civilian responders can simultaneously rebuild civil-police relations and reduce crime. There is some preliminary evidence this may be the case; Dee and Pyne (2022) find that a novel civilian response pilot program for mental health and substance abuse calls in Denver reduced reports of other criminal activity, including in the hours that the program was not in operation. We build on prior work by defining a model to systematically evaluate emergency events for retasking to civilians that incorporates the empirical data on crime risk and costs, and by incorporating uncertainty in these calculations.\\n\\n\\n## 3. Emergency Call Diversion in Large U.S. Cities\\n\\n\\nWe performed site visits to active programs in three large U.S. cities: the Albuquerque Community Safety (ACS) department in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Policing Alternatives and Diversion (PAD) initiative in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Crisis Call Diversion (CCD) and Mobile Crisis Outreach Team (MCOT) programs in Houston, TX. In each jurisdiction, we interviewed between eight and twelve stakeholders, including program administrators, police,\\n\\ncall-takers, and civilian first responders, community advocates that are familiar with the origin and purpose of the diversion programs. We observed each program in the field by riding along with civilian first responders in late-2022 and early-2023. We also collected and evaluated administrative documents and publicly available reports.\\n\\nThe ACS, PAD, and CCD/MCOT programs were all developed to reduce police patrol officer workloads, limit the potential for dangerous and unnecessary use of force incidents, and to reduce call volume by matching those in need to social services.  Other design elements vary 5 in ways that are important but less germane to the present study. Atlanta's PAD is a city-funded non-profit borne from public decarceration activism. Houston's CCD and MCOT programs are partnerships that build on prior successful collaborations between the Houston Police and Fire departments and the Harris Center, a county mental health agency. These retasking efforts predate the police reform movement that stemmed from the 2020 Black Lives Matter mass protests. Albuquerque's ACS was formed in 2021 as a municipal agency parallel to the police and fire departments to address provisions of a 2014 consent decree stemming from evidence of systemic excessive use of force. Tensions exist between police and the community in both Atlanta and Albuquerque due to perceived excessive use of force and overreliance on arrest and incarceration, echoing the sentiments of Baltimore residents.\\n\\nThe programs we observed have notable differences in their operations that help to inform our understanding of call diversion program design. Although the composition of the civilian responder teams varies, each program deployed teams that had expertise in mental health crisis intervention and strong familiarity with available local health and social welfare services to which clients could be referred. Most civilian teams were also equipped to provide basic needs such as hygiene products, bedding, and clean clothes.\\n\\nThe specific incidents to which each program responds also varies, but each targets incident types that were unlikely to involve violence or a weapon and had characteristics that were thought to be better served by civilians with specific technical expertise outside the central tenets of patrol policing. Table 1 lists the call types to which each program responded at the time of the site visits and the analogous call type in Baltimore. Albuquerque Community Safety\\n\\n(ACS) behavioral health and community responders field calls to events involving mental health, substance use, and homelessness issues. In Atlanta, the Policing Alternatives and Diversion Initiative (PAD) responds to indecent exposure calls. The table also includes the Denver's STAR program as another well-known example of an early re-tasking program for which there is evidence of success. In Denver, calls for intoxication, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, welfare checks (i.e., alerts to respond to concerns for someone's safety), indecent exposure, trespass of an unwanted person, and syringe disposal can be reassigned to STAR (Dee &amp; Pyne, 2022). STAR, ACS, and PAD responders only are sent when there is no apparent threat of violence, acute medical need, or serious criminal activity; otherwise, police are dispatched and may request alternative response if or when the threat to civilian responders is minimized.\\n\\nAcross all three jurisdictions we observed, decisions about which calls would receive a civilian response through one of the diversion programs were constrained by risk aversion. For example, although several stakeholders intimated that the present diversion set is too narrow and the call triage process erred toward dispatching police, law enforcement frequently expressed worries about the potential harms to unarmed civilian first responders. This risk aversion carries over to the broader national discourse on police reform. Many U.S. citizens and policymakers orient their understanding around the notion that 911 callers can expect police response. An official who worked with law enforcement and public health officials in the planning and implementation of Houston's CCD program summarized the public's need for emergency response differently after its first five years of operation: 'People call 911 when they don't know what else to do, not just because they want a uniformed officer.'\\n\\nThe interplay between civilian decisions to call the police, call center and dispatcher decisions, and police discretion on the scene is indeed complex. The vast majority of crime is never reported and civilians call the police for a variety of non-criminal matters, which is why diversionary programs may lead to improvements for police and communities alike. Before we detail our model of re-tasking below, it is important to note the complexity of this discretion which we cannot fully account for in our study. On the one hand, individuals who call the police may report inaccurate information (Reiss, 1971), which could spur a chain of events leading to further misclassification or errors. As noted by Black (1970), crime data is also produced by police officers who respond 'on a case-by-case basis to sanctionable conduct' (p.734). While\\n\\nmost studies analyze police decisions to make an arrest, law enforcement officers also make important decisions about whether to record a crime in the first place, which can be influenced by a range of factors related to the individual, the situation, and the community. For example, Warner (1997) finds that police are less likely to record burglary crimes in neighborhoods that are more disadvantaged, but assault did not show this same variation.\\n\\n\\n## 4. Administrative Data and Methods\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4.1. Study Site\\n\\n\\nThis study considers the feasibility of re-tasking police emergency calls in Baltimore, Maryland. Baltimore is an appealing study site for several reasons. In 2020, the city spent $843 per resident on its police department, ranking first among U.S. cities for which data are publicly available (Holder, Akinnibi, &amp; Cannon 2020). Baltimore also has a history of troubled interactions between police and its Black community. Notably, six Baltimore Police Department (BPD) officers were involved in the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray. Although all six were indicted, none were convicted. Major protests and violence marked the death. In March 2017, nine BPD officers on the Gun Trace Task Force were indicted on racketeering charges alleging at least three years of robbery and extortion from city residents (Fenton 2021). Under a 2017 consent decree, Baltimore now collects and disseminates detailed police performance data necessary to monitor the activities of police officers toward reforms prescribed by the decree. These reforms include revision of dispatch policies to cede crisis intervention responsibilities to specially trained officers, 'With a goal of limiting police involvement in crises where appropriate, calls related to crises that do not necessitate a police response will be sent to other crisis services' (U.S. Department of Justice 2017, pp. 39-40). Beginning in June 2021, Baltimore initiated a small pilot program that authorized dispatchers to route calls related to non-weapon suicidal ideation to a community partner, Baltimore Crisis Response, Inc. (BCRI) without the involvement of BPD officers.  The city hopes to expand the program, but we were unable to find 6 evidence of any other ongoing retasking efforts.\\n\\nLike many U.S. law enforcement agencies, the BPD is experiencing a staffing crisis (International Association of Chiefs of Police 2020). Nationwide, police officer staffing declined\\n\\n3.5 percent between 2020 and 2022 and over five percent of budgeted sworn officer positions are unfilled (Police Executive Research Forum 2022). Baltimore's staffing shortfall is more drastic. As of April 2022, the BPD was 25 percent below its planned patrol officer and sergeant force size (Baltimore Police Department 2022). Many police departments are now considering laxer eligibility requirements to expand the hiring pool to candidates that would otherwise not be qualified to serve (Bureau of Justice Assistance and Office of Community Oriented Policing Services 2023). Another method to reduce the staffing shortfall is to reduce patrol officer responsibilities to policing activities that most directly affect public safety and crime control. In this approach, officer resources expended on core duties increase in proportion to the reduction in secondary responsibilities, such as non-criminal responding to non-criminal behavioral health problems.\\n\\n\\n## 4.2. Baltimore Police Department Administrative Data\\n\\n\\nWe rely on 911 call data made available by the BPD that permit categorization of police responses by the disposition of the call event (e.g. recorded crime, situation abated on site, police not needed). The complete dataset is comprised of about 2.5 million community-initiated calls between July 2014 and June 2020; each year about 400,000 calls are received, more than 1,000 per day. Each record includes the event's location, time stamps marking dispatch and the start and end of investigation, and the criminal offense recorded. From these data, we define the probability of a call for service resulting in the report of a Part I crime or that otherwise requires police involvement based on the call's disposition as recorded by the responding officer. Table 2 provides detailed definitions of each call dispositions and Table 3 provides a breakdown of the frequency of each disposition for all calls in the sample. The Technical Appendix contains additional information about the methodology used to determine the probability of crime or the need for police based on observed dispositions.\\n\\nWe also use the time stamps on each service call record to determine how much officer or civilian time is required to clear a service call. Officer time use is determined by calculating total time spent (in hours) responding to each type of call from initial dispatch. Although this is a simple and reliable measure of officer response and investigation time, it may be confounded by factors beyond the incident itself. For example, officers may be required to spend more time on scene for incidents in neighborhoods with more crime or lower perceived police legitimacy\\n\\nbecause citizens may be less willing to cooperate with law enforcement agents (Brunson and Wade 2019; Carr et al. 2007; White et al. 2016). Civilian responders may not encounter these same challenges but may also spend additional time on scene given that arrest or other coercive force cannot be used to resolve the call.\\n\\n\\n## 4.3. Baltimore City Municipal Workforce Data\\n\\n\\nEmployee salary information for BPD officers and other City of Baltimore employees was obtained from the Open Baltimore data hub from 2014 to 2020. These data report the name, title, hire date, and the annual salary of each Baltimore city employee in each fiscal year. We use these data to determine the hourly wage rates of police officers, firefighters with an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Advanced Life Support (ALS), or Paramedic certification, and social workers. On average, BPD officers earned a base salary of about $69,500 annually, or about $38 per hour between FY15 and FY20. Firefighters earned a comparable hourly wage rate, while social workers earned considerably less ($28/hour). The Technical Appendix contains a detailed summary of the data and method for determining wage rates for City of Baltimore employees.\\n\\nWe pair these wage data with officer time use information derived from the BPD service call dataset to estimate to cost of dispatching uniformed officers or civilians to emergency calls. We accomplish this by adapting the activity-based costing method originally developed by Ellingwood (2016) to the BPD dataset. This costing method considers direct resources required in each call for service, which primarily reflects the cost of officer time spent responding to the call. Given that the CFS dataset does not specify how many officers responded to a call for service, we assume that 2.2 officers respond to each call based on a study of the Phoenix Police Department (Huff 2021).  Mirroring other early adopter cities, we assume that one 7 EMT/ALS/Paramedic and one social worker will respond to emergency calls tasked to civilian responders. We provide a more detailed discussion of each of these decisions in the Technical Appendix.\\n\\n\\n## 4.4. Estimating the Change in Police Time Use and Budgetary Impact of Retasking\\n\\n\\nThis study is motivated by the idea that many activities currently executed by police officers may not require their involvement. Reduction of police-civilian interactions in situations with low-risk of crime but high risk of behavioral health problems may in turn reduce occurrences of police violence and improve police-community relations (Vermeer, Woods, &amp; Jackson 2020). We evaluate the empirical distributions of incident types, call volume, call disposition and time use in BPD calls for service data to assess which activities presently performed by uniformed officers could be done safely by non-enforcement actors such as paramedics or social workers. We then use the results of these analyses to determine the implications of reallocating low-risk calls to civilian responders on BPD officer time use and the city budget. Both estimates are informative separately but require careful consideration when viewed together. The estimate of officer time savings assumes that BPD staffing levels remain constant, which implicitly entails expanded investment in civilian first responders. The estimated financial costs (or savings) represent the difference in the expected costs of responding to a set of calls with police or civilians at a predicted annual volume. Since changes in policing and civilian first-responder practices may affect call volume itself, these estimates cannot be directly interpreted as the subsequent reduction (or increase) in the BPD or Baltimore's city budget.\\n\\nWe define a model to estimate the impact of retasking calls that currently are diverted to civilian responders in the early adopter jurisdictions. We begin by identifying 13 constructs that characterize the labor costs associated with responding to calls for service using patrol officers or civilian first responders. In all, we estimate 30 parameters for this model for which we can assign feasible values from a distribution. Table 4 describes the parameters, distributional assumptions, and definitions of identity functions over which we estimate. The column titled 'Mean/Middle' provides the measure of central tendency that corresponds with each distribution or equation. 8\\n\\nWe then apply Monte Carlo simulation methods to translate the uncertainty in each parameter into a range of estimates concerning officer time use and the budgetary implications\\n\\nof retasking. This approach lets us to describe a complex process in a relatively transparent way and predict its most likely outcome while describing underlying uncertainty about this prediction. In this model, we define a set of set of inputs to capture the process that leads from a 911 call, through emergency response, to its final disposition (e.g., the number of calls received, the probability that a call involves a crime, and the amount of time responders spend on-scene). The relationship between each of these inputs and the outcomes of interest (i.e., time use and expenditure) is defined, and each input is assigned a probability distribution (e.g., uniform, normal, triangular). Finally, the model results are generated over 100,000 trials based on random draws from the input distributions. The mean of the distribution for each outcome is its expected value, and uncertainty is captured by the width of the calculated outcome distribution.\\n\\nWhenever possible, we incorporate model inputs directly from Baltimore administrative data. The frequency of incidents per year (row 1), the proportion of cases that result in police reports (row 2), the share of calls in which a response is feasible (row 3), time spent per incident (row 6), first responder wages (row 8), and call misidentification risk (row 14) are all drawn directly from Baltimore administrative data. A subset of the emergency service calls we consider lack an address, complainant, were unfounded, or were the result of a false alarm. These events do not generate Part I crimes and require less time, on average, compared with calls that require the responder to engage with a member of the public. We therefore make an adjustment for calls that neither a police or civilian responder could conceivable respond to in rows 4 and 6 of the Monte Carlo model.\\n\\nBoth empirically derived measures of the need for police that we evaluate-the probability of Part I crimes and the probability that police are not essential-are agnostic about calltakers' ability to correctly classify calls for service into a specific call category and the need for police action. However, an incorrect initial assessment by the emergency call center can be costly. False negatives-incorrectly identifying an event that should be handled by police as divertible-potentially endangers civilian first responders and public safety generally. False positives-incorrectly identifying an event as high risk-results in inefficient use of police resources and present a chance for the misuse of coercive force. Over the study period in Baltimore, we find the false negative rate is 3.6 percent and the false positive rate is 1.5 percent for the early adopter design scenario. In the model, we only estimate the impact of false negatives. It would be straightforward to incorporate false positives as well, but we exclude this\\n\\ncomponent of the model since Baltimore and other municipalities are likely to err toward a police response when an incident may require one because of risk aversion. We estimate the net effect of false negatives in rows 14-23 of Table 4 assuming both civilian responders and police spend more time than average dealing with cases that are initially misidentified. Standard practice in all operating sites we observed is for civilian first responders to retreat and call for police intervention when they feel they are at risk. This procedure is time-consuming but is seen as essential by program architects since it mitigates safety risks to civilian first responders. We provide a detailed overview of the methodology for evaluating the risk of misidentification in Baltimore 911 calls in the Technical Appendix.\\n\\nA few parameters in the model are defined with less empirical support. For example, row 7 indicates that we expect 2.2 BPD officers (with a s.d. = 1 officer) to respond to each call, on average. Practically, this implies that the Monte Carlo model assumes that, on average, two alternative civilian responder hours replace 2.2 BPD officer hours. We also assume that it will take civilian first responders approximately the same amount of time as BPD officers to resolve incidents, though they might take more or less time. There is no empirical basis for this assumption in Baltimore, but we believe a reasonable range based on field observations is 25 percent faster to three times as long, with a modal time that is equal to BPD time use (row 11). The triangular distribution we specify draws a random variable from this specification. We make similar assumptions in rows 16, 19, and 26.\\n\\nOne common theme in the discussion of civilian re-tasking of police events is that fewer arrests will be made. Although evidence to inform this assumption is again sparse, Dee and Pyne's (2022) quasi-experimental evaluation of the Support Team Assistance Response (STAR) program pilot in Denver provides a baseline estimate to consider. They find that STAR reduced arrests for trespassing, public disorder, and resisting arrest by 33.6 percent in affected neighborhoods, which we use as the middle estimate for arrest reduction parameter. We also multiply their standard error by three when calculating the upper and lower bounds of the distribution of the random variable (row 24). This decision reflects underlying uncertainty about how Dee and Pyne's findings for Denver translate to Baltimore, and results in a distribution of feasible values that ranges from a 56 percent reduction in arrests for these incidents to a very slight increase in arrests. The resulting upper and lower bounds of the predicted change in arrests are not symmetric because Dee and Pyne\\n\\nmodeled log-arrest rates. We assume that the median time spent processing an arrest is 1.5 hours with an upper bound of 4 hours and a lower bound of 0.5 hours. The remaining components of the simulation model (rows 2-4, 9-10, 12-13, 17-18, 21-23, 25, 27-30) are arithmetic steps that are entirely based on the inputs we define above.\\n\\n\\n## 4.5. Three Feasible 911 Diversion Program Design Scenarios\\n\\n\\nA core purpose of 911 call diversion programs is to recast the construct of perceived police utility, which is inherently a normative judgement that likely varies across jurisdictions. For this reason, we present a model that can estimate the impacts of alternative program designs. The primary design scenario we consider is based on existing practices of early adopter U.S. Cities: Albuquerque's ACS, Houston's CCD/MCOT, Atlanta's PAD, and Denver's STAR program. The perspective that diversion programs err too far on the side of caution suggests a potentially broader mandate than those of early adopter cities. We therefore consider two potential alternatives based strictly on the available empirical evidence from Baltimore.\\n\\nThe second design scenario is relatively permissive compared to baseline early adopter scenario. All dispatched incident types with less than a 0.01 (1 percent) probability of generating a Part I crime are reassigned to civilian responders. The permissive design scenario is a potentially drastic departure from current policing practices in the U.S. but offers a simple and useful alternative classification method. This is the most aggressive re-tasking design scenario we consider but is consistent with the logic described by several program architects we interviewed.\\n\\nStill, a narrow focus on the probability of a recorded Part I crime minimizes other less serious crimes that are not systematically recorded in Baltimore administrative data and occasions when police on the scene could be beneficial for reasons other than responses to crime incidents. We also note that some calls for service may still merit a police presence even if a serious crime was not recorded. For example, police frequently mediate disputes or control crowds and traffic at the scene of a non-criminal event. These matters may be handled as effectively by civilians without the authority to coerce individuals, but this assessment is ex ante subjective. Current community oriented policing practices that are unlikely to involve coercive force can generate both tangible immediate benefits to public safety and potential intangible benefits toward police-community relations.\\n\\nThis understanding motivates a third design scenario based on two criteria. First, a service call's Part I crime probability must be less than 0.01, and second, the probability that a police response is essential must be less than 0.1. This latter probability is based largely on officers' own assessments. In the BPD data, we observe four mutually exclusive and complementary officer determined call dispositions for incidents where officers can take action: the probability that a report was written after an incident; as well as the probabilities that 'police [are] not needed', and the incident was 'abated on scene' or 'handled in service.' We consider the latter three dispositions to determine when police were not essential to resolve a call.\\n\\nThis restrictive design scenario will err toward a police response compared to the permissive scenario. It will also call for a police response to certain categories of emergency calls that meet the criteria described above that other early adopter cities already designated as eligible for re-tasking to civilians. We note that many of these calls could be resolved by civilians even if police responders often report that their presence was necessary. For example, disputes where no crime is committed may be resolved by personnel with mediation training. Inperson responses to calls about child neglect without evidence of harm may be ably handled by a social worker. Though the third scenario reassigns certain 911 calls based on current police assessments, we highlight the inherent subjectivity in these judgements.\\n\\nFurther, the threshold choices of 0.01 Part I crime probability and 0.1 probability that police are essential are ultimately arbitrary, but these thresholds are consistent with commonly held perceptions of a 'rare' events in scientific literature. Lowering either threshold represents greater risk aversion, as calls with lower risk of generating a Part I crime are also less likely to present risk of harm to responders and citizens in the immediate vicinity of the incident. Raising either threshold would result in a more expansive set of incidents and would be a relatively drastic action to limit police-community contact.\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the difference in the share of 911 calls to be retasked for each of the three design scenarios. To evaluate the alternative design scenarios using the Monte Carlo model, we change the call diversion choice to be based on the permissive 0.01 Part I crime probability threshold, then we adopt the restrictive filter to include incidents that satisfy both the 0.01 Part I crime probability criterion and the 0.9 police not essential probability. For each specification of the model, we vary the definition of calls for retasking and find new statistics for model parameters #2 through #6, as well as #16.\\n\\n\\n## 5. Results\\n\\n\\n\\n## 5.1. Descriptive Analysis of Call Dispositions and Time Use\\n\\n\\nTable 3 shows a summary of call dispositions over the study period. The data indicate emergency calls assigned to the BPD have an approximately equal probability of four outcomes: the event resulted in a police report ('Report Written'; 0.218), was abated after officers arrived on-scene ('Abated'; 0.251), did not require police response ('Police Not Needed'; 0.260), or could not be processed because the event was unfounded, an address or complainant could not be found, or the event was resolved before police arrived ('Unfounded,' 'No Address,' 'No Complainant,' 'Resolved Before Arrival,' and 'False Alarm'; 0.259).  On average, calls take 48 9 minutes from dispatch to disposition, but the amount of time leading to disposition varies based on the outcome of the call. Police spend approximately 23 minutes on calls that cannot be processed, about one hour when a call can be processed, and two hours when a report is written.\\n\\nFrom these basic summary findings, one practical finding is apparent. Over the seven-year study period, more than 50,000 officer hours-equivalent to about 9 patrol officers per year-are spent responding to calls where the associated address could not be found, assuming that 2.2 patrol officers respond to each call. There are call processing technical solutions to this problem that verify addresses are valid prior to dispatch. It is less apparent whether all calls that are abated by uniformed officers would be similarly abated by a civilian first responder. Based on field observations and to maintain simplicity in the specification of our simulation model, we assume this is the case.\\n\\n\\n## 5.2. Differences in Calls Diverted Across Design Scenarios\\n\\n\\nTable 5 displays counts and probabilities that each incident type yields a Part I crime or that police are not essential (i.e., 'Police Not Needed,' 'Abated,' and 'Handled In Service') for the 25 most frequent CFS types based on calltaker incident descriptions over FY2015 to FY2020. 10 We also indicate the share of calls to which police can respond (i.e., calls where a report is written or police are not essential) and whether each incident type would be retasked\\n\\nbased on each of the three design scenarios. In the calculation of the probability that police are essential, we exclude disposition codes where a response is impossible from the denominators because we calculate probabilities conditional on first responders' ability to respond to the call. Only emergency calls that generated a report also result in a recorded crime. 11\\n\\nFigure 2 visualizes the relationship between need for police response and Part I crime. Responding officers most often indicate that incidents are resolved without a report when a call entails a low likelihood of a reported crime. Many common incident categories rarely result in a recorded crime or the need for a police officer response. For example, fewer than 1 percent of calls involving disorderly persons result in a Part I crime and only 8.5 percent are resolved with a police report filed. Similarly, juvenile disturbances, behavioral crises, parking complaints, and loud noises all fit this description (see Table A2 in the Technical Appendix for these probabilities). By contrast, larceny (0.402 and 0.557), burglary (0.295 and 0.498), aggravated assault (0.259 and 0.619) all entail a very high probability of resulting in a Part I crime. Common assault, which is not a Part I offense but can sometimes result in very serious injuries to the victim, yields a sufficiently high risk of ultimately being declared a Part I crime that no programmatic design scenario we consider would re-task these calls away from police. Narcotics calls, on the other hand, yield very low risk of Part I crime and only result in a police report in 6.6 percent of cases. This suggests that status quo policing practices in Baltimore rarely yield crime or arrest despite the well-known links between drug markets and violent crime. The empirical findings from both our permissive and restrictive models implicitly suggest that some other agent may be more effective than the status quo police practice.\\n\\nWe identify nine incidents to which the early adopter programs respond in the Baltimore calls for service data: behavioral crisis, disorderly person, intoxicated person, lewd act, panhandling, person lying on street, sick person, suicide, and suspicious person. All nine incidents have less than one percent chance of generating a Part I crime, but five of the nine have a probability of requiring police response beyond the 0.1 threshold value we consider, based on police assessments: behavioral crises (0.22), lewd acts (0.19), sick persons (0.13), and suicide (0.241). Thus, on this dimension, early adopter jurisdictions demonstrate less risk aversion than the parameter set in our restrictive design scenario.\\n\\n\\n## 5.3. Estimated Change in Police Time Use and Budgetary Impact of Retasking\\n\\n\\nThe emergency calls eligible for retasking by early adopter cities account for 22 percent of the BPD's call volume. We estimate that the total cost of a police response to these calls in Baltimore is about $6.7 million annually. The estimated new costs associated with increasing the civilian workforce to field first responders to reassigned calls is about $7.8 million (95 percent confidence interval: $4.9 million to $12.1 million). After accounting for additional officer time use savings based on reduced arrests, re-tasking generates about $0.8 million in added public safety expenditure by the City of Baltimore (95 percent confidence interval: -$2.2 million to $4.8 million). Uncertainty about police staffing is a major contributing factor to the wide confidence intervals around each estimate. We assume in the model that first responders will be deployed in pairs; as discussed above, we do not make this assumption about BPD officers.\\n\\nWe find BPD time savings of 107,600 hours per year (95 percent confidence interval: 98,000 - 128,900 hours), which is equivalent to 59 full-time patrol officers (95 percent confidence interval: 43 - 75 officers). One component of this estimate is the budgetary impact of false negatives, which increase the cost of re-tasking by about $0.6 million each year. False negatives increase the total labor cost of emergency call response as they require a police response after the preliminary civilian response. The financial savings from a potential reduction in arrests are trivial in the context of the BPD or police budgets generally but may generate important social externalities for the community. 12 Table 6 summarizes the simulation output and Figure 3 plots the corresponding histograms.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the emergency call response cost estimates above rely on numerous assumptions. The wide variation in these estimates is a consequence of uncertainty in parameters that have weak empirical foundation, particularly the amount of time a civilian firstresponder spends at an incident relative to BPD officers, the number of police or civilians deployed, and the effect of retasking on arrests. One other consideration is how retasking is accomplished. Baltimore could opt to hold the police force size constant while adding additional civilian workers needed to meet the emergency call demand. This effectively increases total\\n\\nmunicipal spending on public safety. Alternatively, the city could reduce the police force size commensurate with the reduced emergency call demand, effectively replacing uniformed officers with civilians. Here, practical grounding is important. Given that BPD is already operating well below its planned force size, the city may be unlikely to consider further cuts without external pressure.\\n\\nAdditional sensitivity analysis indicates that BPD officer hours that can be diverted and the net cost of responses to calls for service is positively related to the Part I crime probability threshold, but so too is uncertainty around the model's estimates. Figure 4 plots the estimates derived from the specifications corresponding to our main early adopter design scenario alongside the restrictive and permissive design scenarios that require probability that Part I crime risk to be below 0.01 and the probability that police response is essential to be below 0.10. The expected budget impact remains negligible across these alternative scenarios. However, we demonstrate that greater patrol officer time savings can be realized under both the restrictive and permissive design scenarios. The estimated officer time savings under the permissive scenario is statistically greater than those under the restrictive scenario ( z = 6.65, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the estimated officer time savings under restrictive scenario is statistically greater than the early adopter scenario (  = 3.85, z p &lt; 0.001). However, we only find a statistically significance difference in the expected program cost between the early adopter and permissive scenarios (  = z 2.29, p = 0.022). Due to the inherent risk of diverting calls based on Part I crime risk alone, the estimated impact of the permissive design scenario carries considerably more uncertainty, which is reflected by systematically wider confidence intervals.\\n\\n\\n## 6. Discussion and Conclusion\\n\\n\\nPolice reform advocates contend that many emergency calls could be addressed by civilian social workers, thereby improving police efficiency, performance, and relations with the community. We add to this conversation by measuring and monetizing time use explicitly, and by identifying a broad set of calls for service that are suitable candidates for re-tasking based on the risk that they coincide with an ongoing crime that may endanger the first responder or otherwise require a sworn officer. We specifically consider these reforms in the context of Baltimore, a majority Black or African American city with an above average crime rate and police expenditure.\\n\\nOur primary objective in this analysis is to present a model by which the complex decisions required to design a 911 call diversion program can be systematically evaluated. While the simulation model we define is value free, the assumptions we make in the alternative models are not. As William James opined, 'Objective evidence and certitude are doubtless very fine ideals to play with, but where on this moonlit and dream-visited planet are they found?' Although there is no objectively correct specification of this model, we attempt to make reasonable, systematic, and transparent assumptions to inform policymakers about the potential costs and benefits of diversion programs. In this analysis, we assume police are uniquely qualified to respond to crime events, but civilians may provide adequate or superior response to other types of emergencies. Although we limit the model to evaluate diversion to civilian responders only, many jurisdictions now deploy community resource officers as an alternative to response by traditional police officers. To demonstrate the utility of the model, we define three feasible program design scenarios for Baltimore specifically. However, we encourage researchers and practitioners to add, remove, or adjust the model's current assumptions to reflect the available data on 911 responses in their jurisdiction as they see fit.\\n\\nAdapting the existing practices of early adopter call diversion programs currently operating in four large U.S. cities, we estimate that at least one-in-five calls that are currently fielded by patrol officers in Baltimore can be successfully diverted to civilian responders. The resulting budgetary impact of such a change are negligible, but the time savings to officers and intangible benefits to the community are not. During field work for this study, we observed civilian teams respond to calls involving persons experiencing mental health crises by employing de-escalation methods to gain trust and gather information about the situation and individuals involved, methodically working to resolve the incident. This may lead to quicker resolution of some cases but may also take hours to play out. According to stakeholders, many of the responders' interactions with these individuals were made possible only by the absence of a police uniform and weapon. This leads us to surmise that successful diversion programs will increase total effort expended on 911 call responses in the short term because the rate of calls that lead to dead ends-e.g., a complainant or person requiring assistance leaves or refuses help-will fall with time. In the long-term, individuals who repeatedly call 911 for non-criminal matters may be more likely to find resolution through civilian response. In the jurisdictions we observed, police perceive the benefits of diversion programs both through the reduction in workload that falls\\n\\noutside of core policing duties and through their ability to spend more time on proactive and community-oriented policing tasks. The early adopter design scenario is in some ways conservative about the variety of incidents to which civilians can respond, but it does include incidents when police reports are written and arrests are probable in far more than ten percent of cases, including suicidal ideation calls and behavioral crises. These situations may give rise to inappropriate use of force as persons under duress may be made more volatile by a police presence.\\n\\nPolice (mis)use of force is particularly salient for predominantly Black communities as well. Officers are more likely to use force against Black residents (Knox et al.; 2020; Hoekstra and Sloan, 2022) and in neighborhoods with a larger share of Black residents (Lautenschlager and Omori, 2019). Therefore, diverting calls to civilian responders may be especially beneficial in predominantly Black communities, where the number of interactions with police (and opportunities for force to occur) should be reduced. To be sure, racial disparities in the use of force may not decrease because of diversionary programs, especially if there is no variation in their implementation across neighborhoods. However, given that the frequency of low-level interactions with police should decrease generally with diversionary programs, they could be especially beneficial to communities that are predominantly Black.\\n\\nWe also consider alternative programmatic scenarios based on Part I crime risk and the necessity of a police response in the absence of a crime. Approximately 57 percent of all calls for service currently tasked to uniformed officers have less than a one percent chance of resulting in a Part I crime. Over 40 percent have less than one percent chance of Part I crime and less than 10 percent chance of requiring a police response based on police assessments. However, there is also a small chance that these calls are misidentified at dispatch and will subsequently result in a crime. In supplemental analyses presented in the Technical Appendix, we show that call misidentification risk is relatively constant across communities of varied socioeconomic characteristics after accounting for call-specific characteristics. While the data and analysis show that call misidentification is rare, the stakes are large. In such a situation, the first responder and the community may face threats that a uniformed officer is best suited to resolve.\\n\\nFinally, we consider the time use and financial implications of re-tasking these calls. Transitioning emergency calls from police to civilians has the potential to reduce the labor cost of completing calls for service. Although the estimated cost difference is negligible when\\n\\ncompared against the BPD's annual budget for police patrol, retasking calls currently fielded by early adopter programs may greatly reduce officer time spent on CFS. The IACP recommend that patrol officers should spend 30 percent of their time responding to CFS (International Association of Chiefs of Police 2023). While the true share in Baltimore is unknown and likely higher, the potential reduction in workload associated with early adopter program calls is equivalent to nearly 30 percent of the total time BPD's roughly 690 patrol officers should devote to CFS, consistent with the 9 percent of all patrol officer time we estimate directly. Many U.S. cities currently utilize a 'co-response' or model where sworn officers and civilian clinicians are jointly dispatched to suitable calls for service. This hybrid approach may improve the outcomes of these emergency calls in some cases, but may also require greater labor input which increases the cost of response.\\n\\nThis analysis has several notable limitations. First, the study period is bookended by tumultuous events. It begins with the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray while in police custody which was followed by a historic increase in violent crime in Baltimore. It ends during the COVID-19 Pandemic which had a profound effect on all aspects of life in Baltimore, including the criminal justice system. These events may have impacted the composition of emergency calls received, time use estimates, and the disposition of cases. We elected to incorporate all available data because we cannot yet distinguish whether these shocks led to momentary disruptions in patterns or systemic changes. It is difficult to gauge their impact on the external validity of our estimates, though it is worthwhile to note that many other U.S. cities faced these same challenges during this period.\\n\\nSecond, we assume that officers accurately report incidents. If false positives are undercounted and officers tend to overstate the need for police response and risk of crime, then this analysis is biased toward underestimates the potential financial benefits associated with retasking. In the less likely case that officers understate the need for police, this analysis underestimates the potential costs. In both cases, officers' misrepresentation of public safety risks may produce large intangible social costs. Indeed, prior research suggests that misrepresentation or misreporting may be motivated by a desire to manipulate crime data (Eterno et al., 2016). Failure to correctly dispatch civilians or police to the service calls where they are required may generate social costs such as reduced legitimacy and trust in police.\\n\\nThird, our cost estimates reflect only the labor costs associated with calls for service. There\\n\\nare numerous other costs that are not considered, including training, emergency vehicles, supplies, and the support workers that facilitate emergency response. A conservative assumption is that these costs are equivalent whether the call is handled by civilians or BPD officers. 13 We further assume that civilian workers respond to and resolve calls for service at the same speed as sworn officers. It is plausible that civilian workers will take longer to peacefully resolve some calls for service given that arrest is not option to terminate the encounter. Further, police may still be required even after initial response by a civilian. These scenarios increase the cost of deploying civilians in lieu of officers. In addition, some emergency calls are suitable for social workers, while others will entail medical emergencies that require paramedics or EMTs; these details were not available in our data. A policy of deploying EMT-social worker responder pairs is inefficient, but probably appropriate given the uncertainty associated with responding to an emergency call. It is also likely that EMTs are currently deployed along with BPD officers to many calls for service. Calls for accidents, non-breathing, behavioral crises, overdoses, persons lying on street, and sick persons account for nearly 40 percent of calls with under a one-percent probability of generating a Part I crime record. In this case, replacing the modal response of two sworn officers plus EMT with a single EMT-social worker pair would achieve greater cost savings than our model predicts.\\n\\nWe also make important simplifying assumptions about the composition of first responders to calls for service. However, given the police staffing shortage, single officers may currently respond to some calls for service. We also assume fixed EMT-social worker teams are the only alternative responders, but other combinations of skilled civilian responders are possible. For example, the Albuquerque's ACS Department deploys civilian first responders based on incident acuity. Mobile crisis teams comprised of a police officer and a mental health clinician respond to the most acute situations, while behavioral health responders respond to less acute behavioral crises and other non-criminal events and community responders handle other less urgent calls. Our model's civilian responders approximate Albuquerque's behavioral health responders who are paid higher wages and require more training than community responders. In this sense, our\\n\\nmodel may then understate potential cost savings compared to other feasible program designs. On the other hand, behavioral health responders cannot respond to more acute events where crime risk is low, but higher than the threshold we consider. In sum, our analysis considers only a single civilian response model even though more sophisticated alternative models may be feasible.\\n\\nOne other important consideration is the role of emergency communication centers to facilitate successful re-tasking efforts. Calltakers and dispatchers must be able to effectively determine whether a call for service meets the criteria for a civilian responder. However, recent research suggests that many emergency dispatch centers are not equipped with enough staff or training to make these judgments (Pew Charitable Trusts 2021). Moreover, 911 dispatchers experience high rates of burnout and high turnover (Linos, Ruffini, &amp; Wilcoxen 2022). A successful re-tasking effort will entail an ongoing investment in dispatcher training and support, with attention toward minimizing call misidentification. Disagreement between the initial and final description of the incident can be due to a combination of the calltaker, dispatcher, or responding officers. Our model assumes these factors are exogenous to call diversion program design.\\n\\nWe also assume that calls with the disposition codes 'abated' and 'handled in service' are resolved similarly whether a civilian or police response occurs. This assumption may not hold in practice. For example, narcotics calls may frequently be coded as 'abated' because the scene clears when police arrive, or complainants are unwilling or unable to provide further information. An EMT and social worker may not have this deterrent (or displacement) effect. If, instead, these civilian responders are more likely to engage with the complainant or complainee then our model underestimates the costs of retasking. However, if these interactions lead to a reduction in delinquency through referral to beneficial programming or through a more general social control mechanism, then our model may understate the positive impacts of retasking. Our estimates of police time use and service costs may be biased to the extent that these factors vary over time or location and are not taken into account.\\n\\nWhile this analysis is focused on the time use and cost implications of call diversion, the broader literature on civil-police relations suggests there may be significant nonpecuniary benefits that we do not consider in this paper. As abovementioned, reduced police involvement in low-risk emergency calls lowers the likelihood of violence between police and marginalized\\n\\ncommunities. Even if officers' propensity to misuse force against people from marginalized groups remains the same, the frequency of harmful incidents may decrease. Greater reliance on social workers and treatment programs may also improve community wellbeing, especially given that many programs entail follow-ups by civilian responders (Irwin &amp; Pearl 2020). These followups generate financial and social benefits and may reduce the likelihood of future 911 calls concerning these individuals. Diversion programs may even improve police-community relations, as residents learn over time that calling 911 may indeed return the kind of help they are seeking. However, it is also plausible that these programs may harm perceptions of police legitimacy if a civilian is mistakenly dispatched to an event that requires a police response. Municipalities that introduce a new diversion program should carefully monitor citizen satisfaction and perceptions of police and civilian responders to ensure the program enhances public safety.\\n\\n\",\n          \"## Introduction\\n\\n\\nIn advanced economies, taxation is the most important source of government revenues, often accounting for more than 80 percent of total revenue. Historically, tax revenues grew substantially in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century (Kiser and Karceski, 2017; Seelkopf et al., 2021), and they rose significantly during and after the First and Second World War (Scheve and Stasavage, 2010, 2016). This increase in revenue was largely generated through progressive income taxation, which was used to finance the expansion of the welfare state. During the heyday of Keynesianism in the postwar era, taxation was used to redistribute incomes but steer resources into specific economic sectors (Haffert, 2021; Swank and Steinmo, 2002).\\n\\nFrom the 1980s onward, however, marginal income and corporate tax rates were significantly reduced, as the new tax doctrine was more concerned with efficiency than equity or allocation (Swank, 2006). A general shift from income to consumption taxes occurred (Haffert and Schulz, 2020; Steinmo, 2003), as progressive taxes and taxes on capital were lowered. For example, in the UK, the last pound of earned income at the highest tax bracket was essentially entirely taxed in 1978 (98 percent); since the 2010s, the corresponding figure is less than half (45 percent) (Chancel et al., 2021). Today, the top marginal income tax rate is between half and a third of what it used to be at its highest point in the twentieth century.\\n\\nIt is commonly assumed that this new tax doctrine is also rooted in public opinion. In the first instance, taxes reduce the disposable income of all taxpaying citizens, who are thus said to oppose higher taxes (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015; Berens and Gelepithis, 2019; Roosma et al., 2016). Although there is demand for a more progressive tax system (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015, 2022), voters generally favor lower tax levels. In liberal democracies, this generates pressure for governments to cut taxes. For example, in 2001 and 2003, a large share of Americans supported the tax cuts by the Bush administration (Bartels, 2005).\\n\\nHowever, the widespread support for lower taxes undermines the ability of governments to maintain or increase government spending. Today, efforts to tackle some of the most pressing policy challenges of our time, such as inequality or climate change, are regularly watered down due to limited fiscal resources, while the costs of these challenges are mounting. Discussions about introducing wealth taxes or raising income or value added taxes to raise the necessary\\n\\nfunds frequently fail. This is surprising, given that existing research also shows that voters do, indeed, support climate change mitigation (Dechezlepr\\u00eatre et al., 2022) or welfare state spending (Garritzmann et al., 2018; H\\u00e4usermann et al., 2022).\\n\\nIn a nutshell, these preferences are puzzling: While citizens support higher government spending, they do not want to pay for it through higher taxes. Voters are thus said to want 'something for nothing' (Sears and Citrin, 1982) or 'more for less' (Welch, 1985). However, existing research which argues that citizens support lower levels of taxes usually relies on simple, unidimensional measures of support for a given policy (e.g., should the government increase/decrease general income taxes?). This begs the question to what extent citizens still support lower taxes when they conflict with other fiscal policy goals.\\n\\nIt is commonly assumed that high-income and right-leaning citizens support lower taxes, either due to self-interest or ideological reasons (e.g., Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015; Hennighausen and Heinemann, 2015; Meltzer and Richard, 1981). But how strong is this support once the fiscal trade-offs are acknowledged? Moreover, what are the preferences of people who are cross-pressured, i.e., who are pulled in opposite directions based on their ideology and economic self-interest? Extensive research has shown that left-wing parties have experienced a middle-class shift as structural economic change has substantially increased the incomes of some left-wing voters (Gingrich and H\\u00e4usermann, 2015; Oesch, 2013). Due to rising educational attainment and occupational upgrading, there is an increasing number of people who have high incomes but still support left-wing parties. Therefore, it is important to ask whether these voters respond more strongly to their self-interest or ideology regarding their tax preferences. This crucially determines whether a progressive coalition that opposes tax cuts, composed of low-income and left-wing respondents, is possible.\\n\\nWe contend that unidimensional survey questions likely overstate support for the low tax doctrine because they fail to capture the multidimensionality and complex trade-offs of fiscal policies. Governments must constantly decide how to balance spending and revenues in various areas. Consequently, the necessity to make trade-offs is inherent in fiscal policies. Politicians and policymakers have to weigh the relative merits of various tax and spending plans and find compromises between often conflicting ideal worlds. This should be mirrored in survey questions, where respondents need to weigh their preferences and decide which policy they prioritize .\\n\\nWe thus build on novel research that takes fiscal policy trade-offs seriously (Barnes et al., 2022; Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022a) by using data from an original survey experiment conducted in Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, which allows us to assess how the demand for lower taxes changes when tax cuts come into conflict with other fiscal policy aims. To this end, we confronted respondents with different distributive policy trade-offs. Respondents were randomly assigned to four groups: one control group and three treatment groups. In each group, respondents evaluated three statements on general income tax, top income tax, and value added tax (VAT). Respondents in the control group were given traditional, unidimensional survey statements, while the treatment groups were given statements that raised awareness to different distributive trade-offs with government spending, government debt, or other taxes.\\n\\nOur results show that support for lower income taxes and VAT drops profoundly when it implies lower government spending or higher government debt, while lower top income taxes are always unpopular. On the individual level, preferences are influenced by both self-interest and ideology: high-income as well as right-wing respondents favor trade-offs that have the most regressive distributive effects compared to low-income and left-wing respondents. However, for high-income individuals, ideology dominates: high-income, left voters are even more likely to oppose lower taxes than low-income voters.\\n\\nOverall, the paper makes important contributions. First, we contribute to a new and growing literature on policy trade-offs. In a seminal analysis twenty years ago, Boeri et al. (2001) demonstrated that a positive orientation towards a single policy does not necessarily mean that citizens also opt for this policy when they learn that they have to pay its price through higher taxes or social security contributions. Such hard choice settings and their determinants have recently moved to the center of analyses of social and fiscal policies (Barnes et al., 2022; Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022a,b; Busemeyer and Neimanns, 2017; Busemeyer and Garritzmann, 2017; Gallego and Marx, 2017; H\\u00e4usermann et al., 2019, 2022; H\\u00fcbscher et al., 2021). We enrich this literature by putting taxes front and center. We study public opinion regarding myriad trade-offs between different forms of taxation, government spending, and government debt. Our results demonstrate that support for lower taxes is not unconditional: when respondents learn that the outcome is lower government spending or higher debt, support for lower taxes declines noticeably. Consequently, support for tax cuts is not as high as it is commonly assumed.\\n\\nSecond, we contribute to the vast literature on preferences towards redistribution and taxation (e.g., Cavaill\\u00e9 and Trump, 2015; Iversen and Soskice, 2001; Lupu and Pontusson, 2011). Our results show that particularly regressive changes to the tax systems are the least popular, while more progressive changes enjoy more widespread support. Moreover, it indicates that different respondents react differently to trade-offs. As expected, support for progressive changes to the tax system declines with higher income and increases with a more left-wing attitude.\\n\\nStill, ideology affects the evaluation of trade-offs more strongly than self-interest among highincome, left-wing citizens; they are equally likely to oppose lower taxes as low-income citizens. Hence, only people on the right support lower taxes at all costs. In line with existing work on attitudes towards redistribution Armingeon and Weisstanner (2021) and taxation (Stiers et al., 2022), this finding is important because it implies that a progressive coalition against lower taxes, combining low-income citizens and high-income 'leftists', may be viable.\\n\\nTo make these arguments, we first briefly review the literature on general attitudes toward taxation and further explain the paper's motivation. Second, we develop theoretical expectations about how citizens prioritize different tax policies when they are fiscal policy trade-offs. Then we explain the research design, before we present and discuss the results of the experiment. In the final section, we conclude with a discussion of the broader implications.\\n\\n\\n## General Attitudes Towards Taxation\\n\\n\\nThe study of preferences towards taxation has received increasing interest over the last decade. Although the micro-determinants of attitudes towards taxation are less well understood than the determinants of attitudes towards government spending, the literature shows that most voters are reluctant to pay higher taxes (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015; Roosma et al., 2016; Berens and Gelepithis, 2019). As voters' tax preferences are largely shaped by their (perceived) self-interest (e.g., Franko et al., 2013; Levi, 1988; Meltzer and Richard, 1981), many oppose tax increases. Although individuals benefit from government services in return for taxes, they are often badly informed about their position in the income distribution and about the effect of\\n\\ntax policies (Bartels, 2005; Fern\\u00e1ndez-Albertos and Kuo, 2018; Roberts et al., 1994; Stantcheva, 2021). They view higher taxes as a burden that reduces their disposable income, especially consumption taxes (VAT and general income taxes), and misperceive who benefits and lose from different taxes (Franko et al., 2013; Boudreau and MacKenzie, 2018).\\n\\nOpposition towards higher levels of taxation was not always as widespread. According to Scheve and Stasavage (2010, 2016), the introduction of progressive income taxation in the early twentieth was mainly driven by mass conscription for warfare. It led to demands for an increase in taxation levied on society's wealthiest to distribute the burden of the war across society. Similarly, Limberg (2020) shows that the financial bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis increased demands for higher taxes on the rich, while Dodson (2017) finds that economic recessions more generally increase support for progressive taxes among the working class (see also GarciaMuniesa, 2019).\\n\\nFollowing Barnes (2015), it is, therefore, important to distinguish between preferences for the size of taxation (tax level) and the structure of taxation (tax progressivity), as the modal respondent in seventeen advanced industrial countries favors lower tax levels but higher progressivity. Similarly, (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017) show that among the American public, preferences for taxes are progressive, although they are largely in line with current tax policies in the US. Likewise, Berens and Gelepithis (2021, p. 386) argue that higher levels of taxation are politically unpopular in advanced and developing countries, but that the principle of progressivity enjoys widespread support. Voters expect the rich to contribute more, and this is especially true when demands for taxing the rich are linked to political arguments about why this is fair (Limberg, 2020; Scheve and Stasavage, 2010, 2016). It is, therefore, important to distinguish preferences towards different types of taxes with different distributive effects.\\n\\nIn this paper, we focus on public opinion towards three types of taxes with distinct distributive consequences: general income tax, top income tax, and value added tax. An increase or decrease in the general income tax (across all income brackets) has a relatively neutral distributive effect. A top income tax is generally acknowledged as a progressive tax, where a decrease would imply a regressive and an increase a progressive distributive effect. Finally, a value added tax is a regressive tax, where a decrease would imply a progressive and an increase a regressive distributive effect. Since we are mainly interested in the extent to which public opinion favors\\n\\nFigure 1: Support for lower income tax, lower top income tax, and lower value added tax Note: The figure shows the distribution of (dis-) agreement with statements that 'the government should lower taxes on . . . '. The scale goes from 0 to 10, where 0 means 'totally disagree' and 10 means 'totally agree'.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\ntax decreases, we asked respondents to what extent they agree/disagree with a lower income tax, lower top income tax, and lower value added tax (for more details on the survey, see the research design section). Figure 1 shows that citizens, on average, strongly support lower income and lower value added taxes, while a huge group is strongly against lowering top income taxes. As we argue in the next section, however, claims that demands for lower taxes are strongly rooted in public opinion based on such unidimensional measures of support/opposition towards a specific tax should be met with skepticism.\\n\\n\\n## Tax Cuts and Fiscal Policy Trade-Offs\\n\\n\\nKey to our argument is that different survey designs influence the expression of political preferences and choices that researchers record. As discussed above, the majority of research examines unconstrained fiscal policy attitudes, i.e., it assesses the public's reaction to individual tax policies or spending items. Estimating support for a given policy, where no price tag or trade-off is attached, arguably elicits general orientations about a policy's desirability. However, this approach can be misleading because it ignores the complexity of fiscal policies.\\n\\nWhen designing budgets, governments must always make trade-offs between spending money in different areas and collecting revenues from various sources. Therefore, fiscal policy must necessarily involve trade-offs. Politicians and policymakers need to weigh the relative merits of various tax and spending schemes and find a middle ground between divergent ideals. In contrast to unconstrained preference questions, respondents in choice settings, where the decision to expand one policy entails a decision against the expansion of another policy, have to weigh their preferences and reach a conclusion about which policy they prioritize .\\n\\nAs a result, policymakers would be well-served to avoid relying on unidimensional position questions to gauge public sentiment. The resulting signals are incoherent since citizens can support higher spending, lower taxes, and lower debt at the same time. In contrast, studying priorities provides valuable information to policymakers and scholars alike about which policies citizens deem essential (see also, Hanretty et al., 2020). Thus, an emerging body of research has explicitly studied trade-offs in the realm of fiscal policy (Bansak et al., 2021; Barnes et al., 2022; Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022a; H\\u00fcbscher et al., 2021; Tuxhorn et al., 2021), social policy (Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022b; Busemeyer and Garritzmann, 2017; Gallego and Marx, 2017; H\\u00e4usermann et al., 2019), and environmental policy (Armingeon and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2021).\\n\\nBased on this research, we hypothesize that when respondents are confronted with real-world trade-offs, support for lower taxes is not as deeply ingrained in the public's mindset as it is commonly assumed. The explanation for this is simple: despite findings suggesting that citizens are in favor of lowering the tax burden, this does not square well with other evidence claiming that citizens also favor higher government spending (Garritzmann et al., 2018; H\\u00e4usermann et al., 2022) and lower government debt (Bansak et al., 2021; Brender and Drazen, 2008; Peltzman, 1992). When respondents are informed about the consequences of lower taxes, their preferences may change. For example, Williamson (2017) uses qualitative data from the United States to show that people are more willing to pay taxes when they believe that the money is used to pay for government spending, especially if they perceive it as worthwhile. Using a novel survey experiment that presents respondents with deficit-neutral changes to the budget, Barnes et al. (2022) similarly show that in the UK, citizens are willing to pay for higher spending through tax increases on the scale of seven percent of the total tax bill. This also extends to the US and other European countries, where citizens are open to higher taxes to raise spending or to balance the budget (Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022a; Tuxhorn et al., 2021).\\n\\nIn light of these findings, we contend that when citizens are told about the trade-offs associated with lower taxes, some of them will inevitably place greater importance on government debt or government spending than lower taxes. This reduces the overall support for lower taxes; thus, we expect the following:\\n\\nHypothesis 1 . On average, support for lower taxes declines when respondents are confronted with fiscal trade-offs (lower government spending or higher government debt) .\\n\\n\\n## Theory\\n\\n\\n\\n## Heterogeneous Effects by Self-Interest and Ideology\\n\\n\\nThe way that citizens respond to trade-offs should vary across individuals. In particular, the literature has put forward two explanations that could help to account for citizens' fiscal policy choices: material self-interest and ideology.\\n\\nFirst, citizens do not only evaluate policies based on their expected aggregate (distributive) effects, but they also consider the consequences on their own pocketbook, i.e., citizens prefer to maximize their disposable income. Therefore, citizens' attitudes towards fiscal policies and redistribution are likely strongly rooted in their immediate material circumstances. From a myopic self-interest perspective (e.g., Iversen and Soskice, 2001; Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Lupu and Pontusson, 2011; Rueda and Stegmueller, 2019), the median voter's objective in the MeltzerRichard model is to maximize their income. Citizens with incomes below the population median are expected to favor greater redistribution through increased social spending or higher and more progressive taxation, while citizens with incomes above the population median are more inclined to favor lower social spending and less progressive taxation because their disposable income is more directly influenced by changes in taxation than government spending.\\n\\nThese different preferences should translate into priorities regarding fiscal policy trade-offs. High-income respondents are less likely to benefit from government spending and tax redistribution. They should prioritize trade-offs that have regressive effects. Low-income respondents, on the other hand, should favor trade-offs that have progressive effects. Consequently, high-income citizens should be more supportive of lowering progressive taxation than low-income citizens. The effect of income should be particularly pronounced if lower progressive taxes have regressive trade-offs, i.e., if lower progressive taxes come at the expense of lower spending or higher regres-\\n\\nsive taxes. If lower regressive taxes come at the cost of higher progressive taxes or higher debt, the difference between high- and low-income respondents should be smaller or even reversed, as those with high incomes prefer regressive taxation to progressive taxation and spending. The differences between high- and low-income individuals should be small if lower regressive taxes result in lower spending. Overall, we expect the following:\\n\\nHypothesis 2 . High-income (low-income) respondents should more strongly prioritize trade-offs that have the most regressive (progressive) distributive effects.\\n\\nHowever, it is unlikely that individuals just consider their own material self-interest when evaluating trade-offs. Political ideology is a second factor explaining policy choices. Most of the literature has shown that left-wing individuals are more likely to support welfare state expansion and redistribution through taxation (e.g., Franko et al., 2013; J\\u00e6ger, 2008). In general, leftleaning citizens advocate for higher levels of public spending than right-leaning citizens. In contrast, right-wing voters are more likely to support a lean state, that collects fewer revenues. Moreover, considerations of fairness (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005; Fong, 2001; Scheve and Stasavage, 2016), which correlate with ideology, shape preferences; they especially influence support for 'taking from the rich' (Cavaill\\u00e9 and Trump, 2015). Hence, partisan considerations strongly correlate with preferences over tax progressivity (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017): people do not only consider how taxation affects their own material interest but also how it affects the incomes of others (L\\u00fc and Scheve, 2016). As a result, redistribution considerations strongly influence respondents' tax preferences (Stantcheva, 2021), as people who identify as left-wing are firmly in favor of progressive taxes (Stiers et al., 2022).\\n\\nBased on this evidence, we expect that right-wing individuals are more likely to support lower taxes than left-wing individuals. Again, though, the type of taxation should matter because some taxes are progressive while others are regressive effects, and lower taxes come with trade-offs as well. In particular, we expect that those on the left are less supportive of lower progressive taxes, particularly if they result in lower spending or higher regressive taxes. When it comes to regressive taxes, this difference should be smaller or even reversed: right-wing individuals may be less supportive of lower regressive taxes, especially if they come at the cost of higher progressive taxes or higher government debt. The gap between left- and right-wing respondents\\n\\nshould be small if lower regressive taxes result in lower government spending. Overall, we expect the following.\\n\\nHypothesis 3 . Right-wing (left-wing) respondents should more strongly prioritize trade-offs that have the most regressive (progressive) distributive effects.\\n\\n\\n## Cross-Pressured Citizens\\n\\n\\nIt is likely that some individuals experience cross-cutting conflicts. Due to structural economic changes in advanced economies, particularly through the processes of educational expansion and occupational upgrading (Oesch, 2013), party electorates have been substantially transformed (Gingrich and H\\u00e4usermann, 2015). While the political left nowadays successfully appeals to many educated middle-class voters whose incomes have grown (e.g., Kitschelt, 1994; Piketty, 2021), the political right, in contrast, increasingly appeals to people with lower levels of education and incomes (Kitschelt and Rehm, 2022; Oesch and Rennwald, 2018). This amplifies the possibility of cross-cutting conflicts which emerge from the combination of income and ideology: on the one hand, left-leaning, high-income citizens likely experience opposing pressures from ideology (in favor of redistribution) and self-interest (against redistribution), while right-leaning, while low-income citizens likely suffer a conflict between ideology (against redistribution) and self-interest (in favor of redistribution). On the other hand, low-income left-wing and highincome right-wing citizens are likely not subject to comparable pressures in opposing directions and should be able to make clear decisions in favor of or against redistribution.\\n\\nIn line with findings on general preferences towards redistribution by Margalit (2013) and Armingeon and Weisstanner (2021), we make the assumption that ideology takes precedence over self-interest, especially among left-leaning individuals. The pursuit of material self-interest is substantially at odds with the notion of social solidarity among the left. Even though left-leaning, high-income citizens have a self-interest in less redistribution and lower taxes, this goes against the fundamental tenet of being on the left. Fairness considerations and altruism are particularly strong among those individuals, which has an influence on how the rich perceive redistribution (Dimick et al., 2016; L\\u00fc and Scheve, 2016). Existing evidence suggests that income has little bearing on support for progressive taxation, especially among politically sophisticated voters\\n\\n(Stiers et al., 2022). 1 Consequently, we suppose that they resolve the tension between ideology and self-interest by giving greater weight to their ideological orientation and demonstrating stronger support for redistribution.\\n\\nIn contrast, material self-interest aligns well with the pro-market philosophy of the right. Right-leaning, low-income citizens are less likely to be ardent supporters of redistribution due to ideological grounds, but they are still more likely to do so than right-leaning, high-income citizens. Cross-pressured high-income 'leftists' are, therefore, more prone to forego their own self-interest than low-income right-leaning citizens.\\n\\nHypothesis 4 . The positive effect of income on the priority for regressive trade-offs is weaker among left-wing respondents than right-wing respondents.\\n\\n\\n## Research Design\\n\\n\\nTo test our expectations, we fielded a survey in four large European countries: Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK). In each country, we recruited 1,200 respondents from a pool of eligible voters through large online panels provided by Qualtrics. The sample was representative of all eligible voters based on gender and age. The survey was fielded simultaneously in 2018. 2 Appendix A provides more information about the survey, our sample, and the quality tests that we employed to receive a high-quality sample.\\n\\nWe designed a simple split-sample survey experiment to overcome problems associated with conventional surveys while making modest cognitive demands upon respondents (see Table 1). We randomly split our respondents into four different experimental groups, including one control group and three treatment groups. In each group, we asked respondents to evaluate statements on general income tax, top income tax, and value added tax (VAT). These three taxes were selected to represent direct and indirect taxes and are among the politically most visible and salient forms of taxation. More pertinent to our case, these taxes have very different distributive effects. A change in the general income tax has relatively neutral distributive effects across all\\n\\nTable 1: Design of the survey experiment.\\n\\nNote: The table shows the vignettes assigned to respondents in the four different experimental groups. It also includes our theoretical expectation about the distributive impact of the proposed policy change (neutral, regressive, progressive).\\n\\nincome brackets. A top income tax has a strongly progressive distributive effect. Finally, a value added tax is usually characterized as a regressive form of taxation.\\n\\nRespondents in the control group were asked standard, one-dimensional statements, while respondents in the treatment groups were exposed to statements that emphasized different tradeoffs in order to gauge how the demand for lower taxes changes when it conflicts with other fiscal policy objectives. All respondents were subsequently asked how much they agreed or disagreed with these statements on a scale from 0 to 10 (where higher values indicate higher levels of support). We use the answers to these questions as dependent variables, which enables us to examine the degree to which particular fiscal policy trade-offs are more appealing than others by comparing support across the different experimental groups. 3\\n\\nTo reduce complexity and cognitive fatigue for the respondents, we restricted the number of trade-offs to those theoretically most interesting. We always included one trade-off related to government spending and one related to government debt. The last trade-off is either related to VAT or income tax increases. Further, we made all statements relative to the status quo and do not quantify the specific trade-offs. Thanks to this simplification, we were able to carry out the same experiment in several countries, irrespective of the country's existing fiscal policies (e.g., tax levels and spending levels).\\n\\nAlthough there are reasons to expect some differences across countries, the focus of this paper is less on cross-country comparisons and more on the individual level of respondents. We know from the policy feedback literature that preferences are embedded in social and fiscal policy institutions (Korpi and Palme, 1998; Kumlin, 2004; Brooks and Manza, 2007; Larsen, 2008). They are endogenous to the institutional design of the welfare state and the tax system because these institutions are ultimately rooted in different norms and concepts of reciprocal altruism (Alesina et al., 2001). We acknowledge the possibility of country-specific effects but, given the low number of countries in our study, we refrain from focusing on them. Still, the four countries included in this study, represent major European economies with advanced welfare states, including different varieties of capitalism (Hall and Soskice, 2001) and different welfare state regimes (Esping-Andersen, 1990). This gives us sufficient variation to check whether individual country differences influence our results. 4 Appendix D.1 thus presents our main results for each country individually. 5\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n\\n\\n## Average Treatment Effects\\n\\n\\nFirst, we show, in the upper panel of Figure 2, the predicted mean support for tax decreases in three tax fields without a trade-off (control group) and the three different trade-offs (treatment groups) based on OLS regression analysis. To test the robustness of our findings, we also control for several covariates (e.g., age, sex, occupational classes, income, education, employment status, partisanship, parents with children) and include country-fixed effects.\\n\\nIn line with our expectations, citizens' support for tax cuts is dramatically reduced when confronted with the necessary real-world trade-offs (Hypothesis 1). While average support for a lower income tax and lower value added tax in unconstrained settings is around 6.5 (on a 0 to 10 scale), this declines well below 6.0 for both policies. In most cases, it declines by around 1.5 points to around 5.0. Support for a lower top income tax is already pretty unpopular in an\\n\\nunconstrained setting and does not decline when trade-offs are introduced. This is likely the result of a partial floor effect.\\n\\nFigure 2: Support for tax decreases by treatment and model, all countries pooled. Note: The upper panel shows predicted mean support and 95 percent confidence intervals based on OLS regressions (dependent variable is scaled from 0 to 10; covariates are age, gender, marital status, education, and income). The associated regression tables are shown in Appendix C. The lower panel shows the predicted share of respondents supporting tax decreases and 95 percent confidence intervals, where the dependent variable is dichotomized (6 to 10 support; 0 to 5 opposition/neutral).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nTo estimate the share of people who support lower taxes, we dichotomized the dependent variable. Since we are interested in support for lower taxes, we use five as the cut-off point, i.e., responses from six to ten are counted as agreement, while responses from zero to five are counted as disagreement/neutral. The lower panel of Figure 2 shows that only about one-fifth of the respondents support lowering top income taxes. However, a sizable majority support lower income and value added taxes: 63 percent support lower income taxes; 67 percent support lower value added taxes. This support for tax cuts falls well below a 50 percent majority threshold once we introduce fiscal trade-offs. The only trade-off that still receives a slight majority is the one between lower income tax and lower spending.\\n\\nFigure A.7 in Appendix D.1 also points to a few interesting country differences. Whereas lowering top income taxes is similarly unpopular in all four countries, there are more substantial country differences for income taxes and value added taxes. Lowering these two taxes is most popular in Italy and least popular in the UK. Income taxes are so unpopular in Italy that even with the introduction of fiscal trade-offs a slight majority still favors cutting them. In the UK, where taxes are relatively low already compared to other European countries, there is always a majority against lower income taxes. Even though support for lower value added taxes is also exceptionally high in Italy, such support becomes a minority position in the face of fiscal trade-offs.\\n\\nOverall, our findings confirm that lower taxes are popular in the unconstrained setting. This popularity, however, decreases when trade-offs are introduced. This supports our first hypothesis, which states that support for lower taxes declines substantially once respondents are confronted with fiscal trade-offs. Top income taxes are an exception in this regard. Due to the already low support for lowering top income taxes in the control group, the introduction of fiscal trade-offs does not significantly reduce support levels further. Moreover, the most regressive changes to the tax system, i.e., all policies that lower top income taxes are the least popular, while more progressive changes enjoy more widespread support. The only exception here is the somewhat popular trade-off of cutting income taxes in exchange for lower government spending, which is expected to generate a regressive distributive effect.\\n\\n\\n## Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Income and Ideology\\n\\n\\nFigure 3 and Figure 4 display the predicted support for lower taxes by fiscal trade-off for low- and high-income groups and for left- and right-wing respondents, both derived from OLS regressions with a basic set of covariates and country-fixed effects included. Since we are mainly interested in differences between low- and high-income and between right- and left-wing respondents, we do not show the results for the middle-income and the ideological center groups. However, the full results including those groups are presented in Figure A.4 and Figure A.5 in the Appendix.\\n\\nOverall, differences between income groups are more muted than between ideological groups. Nevertheless, low-income citizens are slightly more supportive of lowering the value added tax. From the standpoint of material self-interest, this makes a lot of sense, given the VAT's inherently regressive distributive nature. There are no discernible differences in support for lower general income taxes across income groups, which bolsters our argument that people have a neutral distributive tax in mind when assessing this vignette. Finally, we do not find any significant differences between low- and high-income respondents in their support for a lower top income tax. 6\\n\\nThe introduction of fiscal trade-offs substantially reduces support for lower taxes across all income groups for the VAT and income tax trade-offs, while support for lower top income taxes is not further reduced. 7 Differences between high- and low-income groups in the evaluation of fiscal trade-offs are surprisingly small and mostly insignificant. Nevertheless, there are some indications that high-income respondents are overall slightly more supportive of regressive fiscal trade-offs. For example, high-income citizens favor lowering the top income tax in exchange for a higher VAT. On the other hand, low-income citizens prioritize a lower VAT at the cost of lower government spending or higher government debt. Although we do not find evidence for Hypothesis 2 in all trade-off combinations, if there are significant differences, their direction thus follows the expected pattern.\\n\\nFigure 3: Predicted values by income groups.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nNote: The figure shows the predicted values by income groups based on OLS regressions. All regression models include covariates and country-fixed effects. The full regression table is shown in Appendix C.\\n\\nHowever, there are three potential explanations why income differences are smaller than expected. First, not all citizens are able to accurately gauge the distributive effects of fiscal trade-offs. Even though it is reassuring to see that our findings go in the expected theorized direction, we still need to know more about how citizens perceive the distributive effects of taxes and reason about them (for a notable expception, see Stantcheva, 2021). Second, there is some evidence that differences between income groups are more pronounced on the country-level and partially cancel each other out when we pool the four countries (see Figure A.8 in the Appendix). For example, low-income citizens are significantly more supportive of the progressive trade-off of reducing the VAT in exchange for higher income tax in Italy, Germany, and the UK, but they are against it in Spain. Finally, income groups have become ideologically more heterogeneous over time and thus income differences are more muted. We will return to this last point in the next section, where we interact income with ideology to study cross-pressured citizens.\\n\\nIn contrast to income, there are more substantial differences between left- and right-wing respondents (based on their self-identified position on a 0 to 10 left-right scale. Figure 4 shows\\n\\nFigure 4: Predicted values by ideology.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nthat right-wing respondents have a much higher support for lowering all three types of taxes in the control group. Thus, right-wing respondents favor lower income taxes, lower top income taxes, and lower VAT more strongly than those from the left. Ideological differences are largest for the progressive tax (top income tax), while differences for the regressive tax (VAT) are much smaller. This might also indicate that the VAT is not perceived or recognized as a regressive tax by many respondents.\\n\\nThese ideological differences between left- and right-wing respondents remain significant and substantial even after we introduce fiscal trade-offs. Overall, left-wing respondents are more strongly in favor of fiscal trade-offs that steer the tax system in a more progressive direction. Compared to left-wing respondents, right-wing respondents favor lower income taxes and lower top income taxes more strongly, even if it implies lower spending, higher government debt, or higher VAT. The ideological difference in support is particularly pronounced for one of the most regressive trade-offs, namely the reduction of the top income tax in exchange for lower\\n\\ngovernment spending. Left-wing respondents also prefer more strongly a decrease of the VAT in exchange for lower government spending or higher public debt.\\n\\nThus, in accordance with Hypothesis 3, respondents on the right have a lower priority for redistribution, while left-wing respondents are adamantly opposed to shifting fiscal policies in a more regressive direction. In contrast to income groups, there are little country-specific differences between the ideological groups (see Figure A.9 in the Appendix).\\n\\n\\n## Cross-Pressured Citizens by Income and Ideology\\n\\n\\nFinally, we want to focus on cross-pressured citizens, particularly left-leaning, high-income and right-leaning, low-income respondents and how they assess fiscal trade-offs. Figure 5 shows the predicted support for lower taxes based on OLS regressions including a three-way interaction (treatment*income*ideology), socio-economic covariates (age, sex, marital status), and countryfixed effects.\\n\\nThe upper left panel shows that in the control group, the income gradient for supporting lower income tax is more important among left-wing than right-wing respondents. In other words, expected support for a lower income tax drops more sharply among left-wing respondents than among right-wing respondents as income levels increase. We observe a similar interaction effect between ideology and income when it comes to lower top income taxes and lower VAT. This is particularly pronounced in the case of top income taxes. At low income levels, leftand right-wing respondents show remarkably similar levels of support for a lower top income tax. When income starts to increase, support for a lower top income tax increases among right-wing respondents but decreases among left-wing respondents. This broadly corresponds with findings from Armingeon and Weisstanner (2021), who show that support for redistribution declines drastically among non-left citizens with increasing income levels. Still, it is noteworthy that left-wing respondents with lower incomes prefer lower top income taxes far more than those with higher incomes, which goes against the premise of material self-interest.\\n\\nBut how do cross-pressured groups evaluate fiscal trade-offs? When we look at regressive trade-offs between lowering general income tax in exchange for higher VAT or lower government spending, we see an even more apparent differentiation. Right- and left-wing respondents differ\\n\\nFigure 5: Predicted support for lower taxes by income and ideology groups. Note: The figure shows predicted support for lower taxes based on OLS regression with a three-way interaction (treatment * income * ideology), a set of covariates (age, sex, marital status), and country-fixed effects.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nmore in their trade-off assessments at higher income levels, with the latter being more strongly opposed to fiscal policy measures that have a clearly regressive distributive impact. Even though they still follow the expected pattern, the interaction effects are less pronounced for lowering top income tax in exchange for a higher VAT or higher government debt. However, contrary to our expectations, we do not find any relevant interaction effects for the trade-offs associated with a lower VAT.\\n\\nOverall, we find evidence in line with our fourth hypothesis, which states that the effect of income on the priority for redistribution is weaker among left-wing than among right-wing\\n\\nrespondents. Our findings indicate that there are significant differences between left- and rightwing respondents at higher income levels. This is not just because right-wing, high-income citizens pursue their material self-interest more fervently, but also results from the remarkable finding that high-income, left-wing respondents are even more supportive of a progressive fiscal design than low-income, left-wing respondents.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n\\nIn the advanced economies, taxes are the most important source of revenue for states. They are used to fund a large amount of government spending, which citizens cherish. Still, taxation is first and foremost a cost for individuals, who are thus said to favor lower taxes. We presented evidence that, indeed, support for tax cuts is relatively widespread if people are presented with unconstrained survey questions. However, once we account for fiscal trade-offs, support for lower taxes drops substantially.\\n\\nThis suggests that tax cuts are often not a priority for voters. As many citizens also support higher government spending and lower government debt, some of them inevitably place less importance on taxes if they (are forced to) internalize the fiscal trade-offs between conflicting aims. Our results further show that the specific tax design also matter. Shifting the tax system in a more regressive direction is much less popular, while more progressive changes enjoy more widespread support.\\n\\nOn the individual level, our findings indicate that preferences and priorities are shaped by As expected, people with a higher income and more rightwing political attitudes are more likely to favor tax cuts, in particular those that are regressive.\\n\\nmaterial self-interest and ideology. In contrast, people who have lower incomes and are more left-wing, are more likely to favor progressive policy changes. Even though income differences are much smaller than ideological differences in the evaluation of fiscal trade-offs, we find that there is an important interaction between income and ideology: when citizens are cross-pressured by material self-interest and ideology, the latter dominates. Most importantly, high-income voters that are left-wing do not strongly support tax cuts when fiscal trade-offs are acknowledged. In fact, they are even more likely to oppose these tax cuts than low-income voters (irrespective of ideology). It is,\\n\\ntherefore, mainly right-wing individuals that support lower taxes at all costs, which opens up the possibility of a progressive coalition against tax cuts, which includes all low-income citizens and the high-income left.\\n\\nFuture research should take up these findings and ask whether this progressive coalition is also possible when it comes to tax increases. In this paper, we focused on public opinion towards tax cuts because existing research suggests that voters in advanced economies favor lower taxes (Berens and Gelepithis, 2021), and it was our aim to test how strong this support is in the face of fiscal trade-offs among different respondents. Yet, initiatives to tackle some of the largest challenges of the twenty-first century, including the green transition and attempts to reduce economic inequality, will depend on states' ability to raise additional resources. It is thus important to ask whether governments can generate sufficient public support to achieve this.\\n\\nStill, our findings are already important for several reasons: First, in line with existing work, our results show that more progressive changes to the tax systems are more popular than regressive changes (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015). Yet, in contrast to this work and a lot of other research on public opinion regarding taxation (summarized by Berens and Gelepithis, 2021), we emphasize that the modal respondent does not necessarily support tax cuts when forced to internalize the associated trade-offs (Barnes et al., 2022), i.e., support for lower taxes is not unconditional. Given that public opinion on fiscal policies strongly responds to elite framing (Barnes and Hicks, 2018; Bisgaard and Slothuus, 2018), political actors opposed to tax cuts could generate majority support for their cause by emphasizing these trade-offs.\\n\\nSecond, the fact that a progressive coalition consisting of low-income voters and the highincome left is possible when it comes to taxes, is good news for the center-left. Many social democratic parties have struggled with the prospect of electoral decline in the last few years. As structural changes have reduced the size of the working-class and political conflicts have arisen that are not classical bread-and-butter economic issues (e.g., migration, climate change, gender equality), it has become increasingly difficult for them to put together a winning coalition of working- and middle-class voters. However, our results suggest that these voters can still see eye-to-eye on important political questions such as taxation. This presents an opening for them to re-build electoral alliances, even if only to form governing coalitions with other parties (e.g., the Greens).\\n\\n\",\n          \"## 1 Introduction\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding the formation of human social structures requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates insights from anthropology, psychology, sociology, neurobiology, and evolutionary biology. Traditional narratives often emphasize cooperation, mutual aid, and collective survival as primary drivers of social structure formation. [1] However, other theories suggest that various factors, including sexual dynamics, resource allocation, environmental pressures, and neurobiological drivers, significantly influenced the development of early human societies. [2] [3]\\n\\nThis paper hypothesizes that human social structures emerged from a complex interplay of these factors, where sexual dynamics and neurobiological motivations played crucial roles alongside cooperation and environmental adaptation. By integrating quantitative analyses and interdisciplinary research, the paper aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how early human behaviors and societal norms developed.\\n\\nThe objectives of this paper are:\\n\\n- \\u00b7 To enhance methodological rigor by providing empirical data and statistical analyses.\\n- \\u00b7 To incorporate supporting hypotheses from interdisciplinary research for each aspect of social structure formation.\\n- \\u00b7 To examine the role of neurobiological drivers, particularly dopamine, in influencing early human behavior.\\n- \\u00b7 To analyze cross-cultural variations in social structures and gender roles.\\n- \\u00b7 To provide a chronological analysis of current data on reported cases of abuse, correlating abusive behavior with law enforcement statistics through a mathematical model.\\n- \\u00b7 To address previous critiques by considering diverse cultural contexts and providing historical nuance.\\n\\n\\n## 2 Methodological Rigor and Quantitative Analysis\\n\\n\\nA rigorous methodological approach is essential for examining the complex factors that influenced the formation of human social structures. This section utilizes quantitative analyses to assess population growth, reproductive strategies, and the statistical probability of certain behaviors.\\n\\n\\n## 2.1 Population Growth and Reproductive Strategies\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: High fertility rates and specific reproductive strategies were essential for the survival and growth of early human populations due to high mortality rates.\\n\\nEmpirical data suggest that early human populations faced significant mortality rates, particularly among infants and young children. [4] Archaeological evidence from huntergatherer societies indicates child mortality rates ranging from 30% to 50%. [5]\\n\\nTo sustain population numbers, it was necessary for women to have multiple offspring. Demographic models show that with a child mortality rate of approximately 50%, a total fertility rate (TFR) of around 6 to 8 children per woman was required for population replacement. [4]\\n\\nInterdisciplinary research from evolutionary biology supports the hypothesis that reproductive strategies, such as cooperative breeding and alloparenting, evolved to enhance offspring survival. [6] These strategies necessitated social structures that supported childrearing and resource allocation.\\n\\n\\n## 2.2 Statistical Probability of Inbreeding and Early Sexual Activity\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: In small, isolated populations, the increased probability of inbreeding was a byproduct of limited mate availability rather than deliberate strategies.\\n\\nGenetic studies show that in populations with fewer than 500 individuals, the effective population size leads to higher levels of homozygosity and increased inbreeding coefficients. [7] Anthropological evidence suggests that early humans developed social norms and taboos against incest to mitigate the negative consequences of inbreeding. [8]\\n\\nPsychological research indicates that the Westermarck effect, an innate aversion to sexual attraction among individuals raised in close proximity, may have evolved as a natural mechanism to prevent incest. [9] This is supported by cross-cultural studies showing that incest taboos are nearly universal, suggesting an evolutionary basis. [10]\\n\\n\\n## 2.3 Enhanced Methodological Approach\\n\\n\\nTo enhance methodological rigor, key variables are clearly defined:\\n\\n- \\u00b7 P : Population size, derived from archaeological and genetic data.\\n- \\u00b7 TFR : Total fertility rate, obtained from demographic studies.\\n- \\u00b7 Inbreeding coefficient ( F ): Calculated using population genetics formulas.\\n- \\u00b7 Mortality rates ( M ): Sourced from anthropological records.\\n\\nStatistical analyses are conducted using real-world data where available, and models are validated against empirical observations.\\n\\n\\n## 3 Integration of Interdisciplinary Research\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3.1 Neurobiological Drivers: The Role of Dopamine in Early Human Behavior\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: Dopamine, as a primary neurotransmitter associated with reward and motivation, significantly influenced early human survival strategies and social behaviors.\\n\\nNeurobiological research demonstrates that dopamine pathways in the brain are critical for reinforcing behaviors essential for survival, such as obtaining food and engaging in reproductive activities. [11] In early human societies, dopamine-driven reward mechanisms would have motivated individuals to pursue activities that increased their chances of survival and reproductive success.\\n\\nInterdisciplinary studies in evolutionary psychology suggest that dopamine's role in reward processing influenced social bonding, mating behaviors, and risk-taking. [12] For example, dopamine-related behaviors could have led to increased exploration and resource acquisition, essential for survival in changing environments.\\n\\n\\n## 3.2 Psychological and Sociological Insights\\n\\n\\nPsychological studies on motivation and reward systems highlight how dopamine influences decision-making and social interactions. [13] Sociological theories on power structures and gender roles provide context for understanding how dominance behaviors may have developed and been reinforced within societies. [14]\\n\\n\\n## 3.3 Alternative Neurobiological Factors\\n\\n\\nWhile dopamine plays a significant role, other neurotransmitters like oxytocin and serotonin also impact social bonding and mood regulation. [15] Oxytocin is associated with trust and attachment, influencing cooperative behaviors and social cohesion. [16]\\n\\n\\n## 4 Empirical Data and Case Studies\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4.1 Anthropological Case Studies\\n\\n\\nStudies on the impact of legal reforms in Scandinavian countries demonstrate a correlation between stricter enforcement and reduced domestic violence rates. [17] For instance, Sweden's implementation of progressive gender equality policies and strong legal protections has been associated with decreased rates of intimate partner violence.\\n\\n\\n## 4.2 Statistical Analysis of Genetic Data\\n\\n\\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variations in dopamine receptor genes (e.g., DRD4) that are associated with differences in social behaviors across populations. [18] Statistical analyses using regression models can quantify the relationship between these genetic variations and societal structures.\\n\\n\\n## 4.3 Longitudinal Studies on Societal Norms\\n\\n\\nAnalyzing data from longitudinal studies, such as those conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), reveals trends in abuse reporting correlated with educational campaigns and shifts in societal attitudes. [19] Increased societal awareness ( S ) has been linked to higher reporting rates ( r ) and decreased dark number coefficients ( d ).\\n\\n\\n## 5 Mathematical Model and Statistical Validation\\n\\n\\n\\n## 5.1 Refined Mathematical Model\\n\\n\\nThe mathematical model is refined with clear definitions:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n- \\u00b7 A : Actual number of abuse cases.\\n- \\u00b7 P : Population size.\\n- \\u00b7 r : Reported cases per capita.\\n- \\u00b7 d : Estimated unreported cases per capita (dark number coefficient).\\n- \\u00b7 k : Constant representing baseline prevalence.\\n- \\u00b7 E : Effectiveness of law enforcement (e.g., conviction rates, legal resource allocation).\\n- \\u00b7 S : Societal awareness and acceptance (e.g., education levels, public opinion surveys).\\n\\n\\n## 5.2 Statistical Validation Using Regression Analysis\\n\\n\\nAdvanced statistical methods, such as multiple regression analysis, are employed to validate the model with real-world data. By inputting data from various countries with differing E and S values, we can assess the model's predictive accuracy.\\n\\n\\n## 6 Testable Predictions and Hypotheses\\n\\n\\n\\n## 6.1 Prediction 1: Impact of Law Enforcement Effectiveness\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: An increase in the effectiveness of law enforcement ( E ) will lead to a measurable decrease in the dark number coefficient ( d ).\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Testable Prediction: Countries that implement reforms to improve law enforcement effectiveness will observe a reduction in unreported abuse cases over time.\\n\\n\\n## 6.2 Prediction 2: Genetic Correlations with Social Behavior\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: Populations with higher prevalence of certain dopamine receptor genes associated with reward-seeking behavior will exhibit social structures reflecting higher competitiveness.\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Testable Prediction: Genetic studies will show correlations between DRD4 gene variants and societal measures of competitiveness and individualism.\\n\\n\\n## 6.3 Prediction 3: Influence of Societal Awareness\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: Educational interventions that enhance societal awareness ( S ) will correlate with increased reporting rates ( r ) and decreased unreported cases ( d ).\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Testable Prediction: Implementation of nationwide awareness campaigns will result in higher rates of abuse reporting and lower estimates of unreported cases.\\n\\n\\n## 7 Consideration of Confounding Variables\\n\\n\\n\\n## 7.1 Economic Conditions\\n\\n\\nEconomic instability or poverty may affect both abuse rates and reporting practices. [20] To control for this, economic indicators such as GDP per capita are included in the regression model as covariates.\\n\\n\\n## 7.2 Political Stability\\n\\n\\nRegions with political turmoil may have compromised law enforcement effectiveness. Political stability indices are incorporated into the analysis to account for this variable.\\n\\n\\n## 7.3 Technological Access\\n\\n\\nAccess to communication technologies can influence reporting rates and societal awareness. [21] Internet penetration rates and mobile phone usage statistics are used as proxies for technological access.\\n\\n\\n## 8 Expanding the Theoretical Framework\\n\\n\\n\\n## 8.1 Evolutionary Psychology\\n\\n\\nIntegrate theories on mate selection and social behavior, such as sexual selection theory, to explain dominance behaviors. [22]\\n\\n\\n## 8.2 Social Learning Theory\\n\\n\\nExplore how behaviors and norms are transmitted across generations through observation and imitation. [23] Cultural practices may reinforce or challenge dominance structures.\\n\\n\\n## 8.3 Technological Influence\\n\\n\\nConsider the role of technological advancements in shaping social structures, communication, and awareness. [24] The rise of social media has impacted societal awareness ( S ) and reporting behaviors ( r ).\\n\\n\\n## 9 Conclusion\\n\\n\\nThis paper has applied a rigorous empirical and methodological approach to examine the persistence of sexual dominance throughout human history. By integrating quantitative analyses with interdisciplinary research across anthropology, evolutionary biology, sociology, and neurobiology, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of how sexual dynamics have consistently shaped human social structures.\\n\\nThe empirical data, including population growth models, reproductive strategies, and the statistical probability of behaviors such as inbreeding, offer insight into the evolutionary drivers behind the formation of patriarchal systems. Genetic data on dopamine receptor variations, combined with neurobiological studies on reward mechanisms, demonstrate how neurochemical influences have reinforced dominance behaviors, particularly in male-female power dynamics.\\n\\nThe mathematical models developed in this research, such as the regression analysis of societal awareness and law enforcement effectiveness on the prevalence of abuse, provide strong empirical support for the correlation between social control mechanisms and the persistence of sexual dominance. These models underscore the role of law enforcement and societal awareness in mitigating or perpetuating these power imbalances, offering quantifiable evidence of the relationship between gender-based violence and structural patriarchy.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [1] Diamond, Jared M.

Employing a methodological analysis of translated extracts and a review of relevant literature, the research investigates the impact of collaborative translation, particularly the tension between Alsanea\\'s self-translation aims and Booth\\'s literal approach, on the preservation of idiomatic, social, and cultural references. The findings indicate that the tension led to a compromise, often resulting in the omission or alteration of culturally specific features, with Boothâ€™s literalist approach clashing with Alsaneaâ€™s intent to maintain Saudi dialect and culture. The study further evaluates the effectiveness of literal versus functional translation approaches within this collaborative framework, ultimately highlighting the complex influence of translation strategies and author-translator dynamics on translation fidelity.',\n",
              " 170: 'This research emphasizes the widespread stigmatization of ADHD, highlighting how it manifests through negative characterizations and social stereotypes that persist from childhood into adulthood, leading to adverse long-term outcomes such as reduced treatment seeking, psychological distress, and diminished life opportunities. The study employs a review of existing literature to elucidate how stigmatization affects individualsâ€™ mental health, social functioning, and economic stability, with particular concern about its impact on vulnerable groups like college students and workers. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated ADHD symptoms and increased treatment demands, underscoring the importance of addressing societal perceptions in different cultural contexts. Recognizing the lack of research on ADHD stigma in Taiwan, the findings suggest a critical need for social perception studies to inform interventions that can reduce harm caused by harmful stereotypes and improve life outcomes for those affected.',\n",

Using bibliometric analysis to examine the distribution of research investments and a stakeholder survey to gauge perceptions of desirable research priorities, the authors contrast de facto research directions with societal expectations, focusing on upstream (preventive and systemic) versus downstream (clinical and restorative) approaches. The findings reveal a mismatch between current research investments, which predominantly focus on downstream interventions, and stakeholder perceptions that emphasize upstream, systemic solutions to health issues. The study highlights the necessity of broader institutional changes to realign research priorities with societal needs, advocating for reflexive monitoring frameworks that support transformative and mission-driven health research policies.',\n",

Using Vygotsky's social constructivist framework and the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, the research explores how scaffolded instructional support can enhance students' cohesion, structure, and accuracy in writing by fostering interaction and knowledge construction within a social context. Data collected from student perspectives indicate that scaffolding improves writing fluency, clarity, and independence by providing targeted, adaptive guidance that aligns with students' evolving needs. Overall, the findings suggest that tailored scaffolding strategies rooted in social constructivism effectively support ESL learners in overcoming common writing difficulties.\"}"

Although reporting on preprints has long been discouraged (e.g., Sheldon, 2018), it became common practice during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fleerackers, Shores, et al., 2024; Fraser et al., 2021; Massarani et al., 2021). Recommendations for public communication about preprints often include informing audiences about their un-peer-reviewed status, based on an assumption that this will help build understanding of the tentativeness of the science and strengthen trust in science communication (Van Schalkwyk &amp; Dudek, 2022). Yet evidence is mixed with respect to whether public audiences notice information about preprint status when it is provided, and, if they do, whether this information is interpreted as an indicator of preliminary science or a marker of trustworthy communication.\\n\\nAn emerging body of research suggests that general public audiences seem largely unfamiliar with the concept of a preprint (Cataldo et al., 2023; Citation withheld; Ratcliff et al., 2024), calling into question the utility of including details about a study\\u2019s preprint status in news reports. However, to our knowledge, only a few studies have tested this experimentally (e.g., Ratcliff et al., 2024; Wingen et al., 2022). Wingen and colleagues (2022) found that labeling research as a \\u201cpreprint,\\u201d combined with an explanation of the term, led individuals to see the research as less credible compared to labeling the study as \\u201cpeer-reviewed.\\u201d Ratcliff et al. (2024) embedded the preprint disclosure in a news story and found no effect on perceived credibility of the reporting or behavioral intentions related to the preprint science (in this case, whether to receive a vaccine); however, this study did not assess perceptions of the disclosure or whether the science was considered reliable.\\n\\nResearch and theory on public communication of scientific uncertainty suggest that audience perceptions of both the science and the disclosure can influence message outcomes. For instance, Jensen (2008) found that positive effects of scientific uncertainty disclosure on news credibility were mediated by perceptions of the disclosure. In contrast, others found negative effects of uncertainty disclosure (e.g., on behavioral intentions or trust in the scientists) mediated by perceptions of the science as being uncertain (Adams et al., 2024; Ratcliff et al., 2021). Although both perceived uncertainty disclosure and perceived scientific uncertainty have been used as manipulation checks, O\\u2019Keefe (2003) argued that manipulation check variables are often usefully explored as mediators. In the current context, examining these perceptions as mediators aligns with frameworks for understanding the effects of conveying scientific uncertainty to public audiences, which suggest that effects are nuanced and likely to depend on mediating factors such as message perceptions (e.g., Ratcliff &amp; Wicke, 2023; Van der Bles et al., 2019). As preprint status can be thought of as a form of scientific uncertainty (Nanayakkara &amp; Hullman, 2020), these frameworks may be useful for examining the effects of communicating information about preprint status. In all, this highlights the value of examining perceptions of preprint disclosure and perceptions of preprint uncertainty as mediators of the impacts of disclosing a preprint\\u2019s status on outcomes, such as audience ratings of news credibility and relevant behavioral intentions.\\n\\n\\nThe Current Study\\n\\n\\nThis study examined how a general public audience would evaluate a news story featuring a COVID-19 preprint depending on whether its preprint status was disclosed. Based on prior research, we tested whether a disclosure would affect outcomes (perceived news credibility, precautionary behavioral intentions) either directly (RQ1) or indirectly via perceived preprint disclosure or perceived scientific uncertainty (RQ2). Given the political polarization of COVID-19 in the U.S. (Calvillo et al., 2020), we also examined whether political party leaning moderated these effects (RQ3). Lastly, based on the model proposed by Ratcliff and Wicke (2023), we tested whether preprint disclosure might influence intentions via effects on perceived credibility of the information (i.e., perceived disclosure/uncertainty  news credibility  intentions; RQ4).\\n\\nAdditionally, because findings by Wingen et al. (2022) suggested the amount of detail about preprint status might make a difference in audience perceptions, we compared a brief preprint disclosure (similar to the manipulation in Ratcliff et al., 2024) to an expanded disclosure, described below. Embedded in each RQ is a comparison of whether audiences evaluate a brief versus expanded preprint disclosure differently.\\n\\n## Method\\n\\n\\nStudy Design and Procedure\\n\\n\\nWe conducted a single-factor, between-participants online experiment comparing three versions of a news report. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions: (1) control, (2) preprint disclosure with a brief description, or (3) preprint disclosure with an expanded description. Prior to reading the news report, participants provided demographic information. Following the report, they responded to questions about the report and their behavioral intentions related to the findings of the preprint study. We hired Qualtrics Panel Services to collect a sample of at least 400 respondents. Data collection occurred in March of 2021, roughly one year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible participants were U.S. residents aged 18 and older. A university IRB (masked for review) approved this study.\\n\\n### Stimulus Development\\n\\nThe experimental stimuli consisted of a recent news report that described a preprint study identifying Mardi Gras as a \\u201csuper-spreader\\u201d event, linking it to a surge in COVID-19 cases in Louisiana. We modified preprint disclosure in ways that mirrored existing preprint news coverage (Fleerackers, Riedlinger et al., 2022; Van Schalkwyk &amp; Dudek, 2022). Specifically, we varied whether the news report described the research as simply a \\u201cstudy\\u201d (control condition) or as a \\u201cpreprint\\u201d with contextualizing clues (i.e., mentioning that the study had not undergone peer review, was posted online by the authors, or was not yet published in a scientific journal). To operationalize level of disclosure, we used one cue to represent brief disclosure and all three cues to represent expanded disclosure (see Box 1). As in the original news report, all versions of the stimuli featured an interview with the scientist responsible for the research but descriptions of preprint status were provided by the journalist. Full stimuli appear in the Supplement S1.\\n\\n### Measures\\n\\n#### Demographics\\n\\nTo characterize the sample, we collected data on participants\\u2019 age, gender, education, race/ethnicity, and whether they had ever had COVID-19. Additionally, to address RQ3, we asked about participants\\u2019 political affiliation. Given the politically-polarized context, we captured political party leaning, asking whether participants see themselves as closer to the Republican or Democratic Party (1 = Republican, 2 = Democrat).\\n\\n#### Mediators\\n\\nPerceived preprint disclosure. Using a scale developed for this study, participants rated agreement with three statements: \\u201cThe article acknowledged that the study is a preprint,\\u201d \\u201cThe article stressed that the research has not undergone scientific peer review,\\u201d and \\u201cThe article noted that the study has not been published in a scientific journal\\u201d (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The third statement reflects information that was explicitly conveyed only in the Expanded Disclosure condition. However, sample mean scores were nearly identical for the three-item measure (M = 3.65, SD = .92) and the two-item measure (M = 3.63, SD = .98). Because internal consistency was better for the three-item measure (\\u03b1 = .70) than the two-item measure (\\u03b1 = .60), we used the three-item measure for analyses.\\n\\nPerceived scientific uncertainty. Participants rated whether the research described in the news report seemed certain, known for sure, established, without any doubt, settled, and able to be firmly relied on. Items were worded in terms of certainty and then reversed to represent uncertainty for analyses. Participants rated agreement on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree; M = 3.85, SD = 1.51). The six-item scale was reliable (\\u03b1 = .95).\\n\\n#### Outcomes\\n\\nNews article credibility. Participants evaluated the news report\\u2019s depiction of the research in terms of whether it was balanced (i.e., fair, accurately represented, realistic, and open-minded) and trustworthy (i.e., honest, ethical, trustworthy, and reliable), using a scale adapted from Abdulla et al. (2004). Although the two dimensions of news credibility are sometimes treated as separate variables, Yale et al. (2015) demonstrated that the subscales can be combined to form a unidimensional measure. An exploratory factor analysis also indicated a unidimensional measure in our data. Therefore, we combined the items into a single scale for simplicity. Participants rated agreement on a 7-point scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very much; M = 4.99, SD = 1.43). The eight-item scale was reliable (\\u03b1 = .95).\\n\\nSocial distancing intentions (pretest and posttest). Given that the research presented in the news report pertained to social distancing as a way to limit the spread of COVID-19, we assessed related intentions as an outcome variable. Participants were asked in both the pretest and posttest how likely they were to \\u201cEngage in social distancing\\u201d and \\u201cPut a distance between yourself and other people\\u201d to slow the spread of COVID-19 (1 = extremely unlikely, 7 = extremely likely). These two items were combined to make a composite variable. The overall intention level was high in both the pretest (M = 6.00, SD = 1.60) and the posttest (M = 6.03, SD = 1.51), although intentions varied by experimental condition, as we report later.\\n\\n\\nMain Effects on News Credibility and Intentions (RQ1)\\n\\n\\nWe report means, standard deviations, and main effects on all response variables in Table 1. Preprint disclosure had no main effect on news credibility. Additionally, a repeated measures ANOVA showed no meaningful difference between pretest and posttest social distancing intentions for any of the three message conditions.\\n\\n### Indirect Effects via Perceptions (RQ2)\\n\\nRQ2 queried whether disclosing preprint status would influence news report credibility or behavioral intentions via perceptions of preprint disclosure or of scientific uncertainty. Before testing RQ2, we first examined direct effects on both perception variables.\\n\\nPerceived preprint disclosure was greater for both preprint conditions compared to the control, indicating that participants recognized both levels of disclosure. However, as shown in Table 1, perceived disclosure was higher for participants who received the expanded disclosure (control vs. expanded: Cohen\\u2019s d = 1.01) compared to the brief disclosure (control vs. brief: Cohen\\u2019s d = .69)\\u2014a difference that was statistically significant (brief vs. expanded: Cohen\\u2019s d = .34).\\n\\nOnly participants in the expanded preprint disclosure condition perceived the science to be uncertain (control vs. expanded: Cohen\\u2019s d = .28). Uncertainty perceptions for the brief disclosure condition did not significantly differ from the control condition. We also confirmed that perceived disclosure did not mediate the relationship between preprint disclosure and perceived uncertainty (see Supplement S3). It did not, and the correlation between perceived uncertainty and perceived preprint disclosure was trivial (r = .10, p = .048). Given this, we examined the two perceptions as parallel mediators.\\n\\nFor news credibility, results showed the two perceptions acting in opposite ways: perceived disclosure positively mediated the effect of disclosing preprint status on news article credibility, while perceived uncertainty negatively mediated this effect (see Fig. 1). The positive indirect effect via perceived disclosure was significant for both the brief and the expanded disclosure conditions, but stronger for the latter. However, the negative indirect effect via perceived uncertainty was only significant for the expanded disclosure condition (owing to lack of a main effect on perceived uncertainty for the brief condition).\\n\\nFor social distancing intentions, results were similar: perceived disclosure positively mediated the effect of disclosing preprint status on intentions, for both the brief and expanded disclosure conditions (see Fig. 2). Again, there was a negative indirect effect via perceived uncertainty but only for the expanded disclosure condition.\\n\\n### Moderating Role of Political Leaning (RQ3)\\n\\nRQ3 asked whether political leaning would moderate the indirect effect of preprint disclosure on news credibility or intentions via perceptions of preprint disclosure or scientific uncertainty. To answer this, we used PROCESS Model 58, which tests the influence of the moderator on both the a and b pathways\\u2014in this case, the paths between preprint disclosure and perception, and between perception and news credibility or intentions\\u2014and allows for testing both perception mediators in parallel. For analyses, this variable was coded as 1 = Republican, 2 = Democrat.\\n\\nPolitical leaning did not modify the indirect effect of disclosure on news credibility via perceived disclosure (brief disclosure: index of moderated mediation = \\u2013.03, Boot SE=.12, Boot CI: \\u2013.26, .21; expanded disclosure: index of moderated mediation = .07, Boot SE=.14, Boot CI: \\u2013.20, .34). However, political leaning did modify the indirect effect of disclosure on news credibility via perceived scientific uncertainty\\u2014but only for the expanded disclosure condition (index of moderated mediation = .41, Boot SE=.18, Boot CI: .07, .75), not the brief disclosure condition (index of moderated mediation = .26, Boot SE=.16, Boot CI:\\u00a0\\u2013.05, .58). Specifically, the negative indirect effect was only significant for Republican-leaning participants (effect = \\u2013.45, Boot SE = .15, Boot CI: \\u2013.76, \\u2013.16), not those who were Democrat-leaning (effect = \\u2013.04, Boot SE = .09, Boot CI: \\u2013.21, .13).\\n\\nThe same pattern emerged for intentions as an outcome, controlling for pretest intentions. Political leaning did not modify the indirect effect of disclosure on social distancing intentions via perceived disclosure (brief disclosure: index of moderated mediation = \\u2013.04, Boot SE=.07, Boot CI: \\u2013.17, .10; expanded disclosure: index of moderated mediation = \\u2013.03, Boot SE=.10, Boot CI: \\u2013.21, .17). However, political leaning did modify the indirect effect of disclosure on news credibility via perceived scientific uncertainty, again only for the expanded disclosure condition (index of moderated mediation = .13, Boot SE=.06, Boot CI: .02, .27), not the brief disclosure condition (index of moderated mediation = .08, Boot SE=.05, Boot CI:\\u00a0\\u2013.02, .19). Here again, the negative indirect effect was only significant for Republican-leaning participants (effect = \\u2013.14, Boot SE = .06, Boot CI: \\u2013.27, \\u2013.04), not Democrat-leaning individuals (effect = \\u2013.01, Boot SE = .02, Boot CI: \\u2013.05, .03).\\n\\nFollow-up subgroup analysis revealed that, when receiving an expanded preprint disclosure, only Republican-leaning participants perceived the research to be more uncertain (expanded disclosure vs. control: Mdiff = .82, p = .003). The effect did not occur for Democrat-leaning participants (expanded disclosure vs. control: Mdiff = .11, p = .63), and neither group perceived a brief preprint disclosure as indication the research was more uncertain (see Supplement S4).\\n\\n### Serial Indirect Effects of Disclosure on Intentions (RQ4)\\n\\nGiven the results for RQ2, it made sense to proceed with RQ4, testing whether indirect effects of disclosure on intentions might be explained by the effect on news credibility. Tests of serial mediation controlling for political leaning (PROCESS Model 6) revealed a small positive indirect effect on intentions via perceived disclosure and perceived credibility (i.e., preprint disclosure  perceived disclosure  news credibility  intentions), which emerged for both the brief disclosure (effect = .08, BootSE = .03, 95% CI: .04, .15) and the expanded disclosure (effect = .13, BootSE = .04, 95% CI: .06, .21). Effects were smaller, but still statistically significant, when political leaning was not covaried in the model (see Supplement S5).\\n\\nThere was a small negative indirect effect on intentions via perceived uncertainty and perceived credibility, but only for the expanded disclosure (effect = \\u2013.07, BootSE = .03, 95% CI: \\u2013.14, \\u2013.01), not the brief disclosure (effect = \\u2013.02, BootSE = .03, 95% CI: \\u2013.07, .03). Notably, this effect was only statistically significant when political leaning was controlled for.\\n\\nThese findings suggest that indirect effects of disclosure on intentions might be explained, at least in part, by an effect of the disclosure on perceived credibility of the reporting.\\n\\n\\nExploratory Analyses of Other Potential Moderators\\n\\n\\nThis study was embedded in a larger survey (Citation withheld) which contained data on a range of audience characteristics, including educational attainment, scientific literacy, information preferences, and understanding of preprints. This enabled us to go back and perform exploratory analyses to determine whether any of these characteristics might have influenced the relationships between the preprint disclosures and perceptions of disclosure or uncertainty. As we report in the Supplement (S6), several moderating relationships emerged. The relationship between preprint disclosure and perceived disclosure\\u2014while significant at all levels of all four variables\\u2014was stronger at higher levels of each variable. Interaction coefficients were as follows for education (brief disclosure: effect = .17, SE = .09, p = .06; expanded disclosure: effect = .17, SE = .09, p = .06), scientific literacy (brief disclosure: effect = .19, SE = .07, p = .006; expanded disclosure: effect = .16, SE = .07, p = .02), preference for information about scientific uncertainty (brief disclosure: effect = .30, SE = .13, p = .02; expanded disclosure: effect = .22, SE = .13, p = .09), and preprint understanding (brief disclosure: effect = .65, SE = .26, p = .01; expanded disclosure: effect = .95, SE = .27, p &lt; .001).\\n\\nNone of these variables moderated the relationship between preprint disclosure and perceived uncertainty, except for in a single instance: the relationship between expanded disclosure and perceived uncertainty was stronger for those with greater scientific literacy (interaction coefficient = .24, SE = .13, p = .06). Measures and outputs for these analyses can be found in the Supplement S6.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n\\nPreprints gained traction in the public dissemination of scientific findings during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fleerackers, Shores, et al., 2024). This study is among the first to experimentally test whether conveying information about a study\\u2019s preprint status influences public perceptions. Prior experiments with general public audiences found that disclosing a study\\u2019s preprint status either had no effect on perceptions of the research and related outcomes (Ratcliff et al., 2024) or it lowered perceived credibility of the research\\u2014but only when an explanation of peer review was provided (Wingen et al., 2022). This may lead science communicators to conclude that mentioning details about a study\\u2019s preprint status is unnecessary or even disadvantageous\\u2014but is this the right conclusion?\\n\\nIn the current study, we found evidence of a positive impact of disclosure on trust in the news reporting, contingent on perceiving the preprint disclosure. This effect, in turn, had a small positive indirect effect on precautionary behavioral intentions. While even a brief disclosure was perceptible and produced positive indirect effects, the effects were enhanced by including more detail in the disclosure (i.e., including three contextual clues instead of just one). Post hoc analyses revealed that perception of the disclosure was enhanced by (but not conditional upon) higher levels of educational attainment, scientific literacy, preference for information about uncertain science, and understanding of preprints.\\n\\nOn the other hand, negative effects of preprint disclosure emerged when participants perceived the research to be uncertain. This only occurred for the expanded disclosure and only for Republican-leaning individuals, as Democrat-leaning participants did not perceive the research to be more uncertain when disclosed as a preprint. This finding is similar to Adams et al. (2024), who found perceived scientific uncertainty to negatively mediate the effect of disclosing expert uncertainty about COVID-19 recommendations (rather than preprint status) on social distancing intentions. Given politically polarized attitudes toward COVID-19 science in the U.S. (Calvillo et al., 2020), it is possible that motivated reasoning led participants to interpret the disclosure in line with their prior beliefs about the research (see Chang, 2015). Thus, it will be important to replicate our study in contexts where audiences have not already formed strong opinions. Studies in other national and political contexts are also needed.\\n\\nRelated to the prior point, the observed indirect effects of disclosure on behavioral intentions were quite small, which may be due to a ceiling effect: social distancing intentions were already fairly high among participants (pretest M = 6.00/7). Data collection occurred one year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when social distancing had become a norm, so it is possible that preprint disclosure would have had a stronger influence earlier on. To better understand the impact on public decision-making, future studies should examine the effects of communicating about preprint status for non-COVID-19-related issues\\u2014and perhaps non-polarizing issues, as well, given the political leaning findings.\\n\\nOverall, our findings suggest there is value in reporting details about the preprint status of research in public science communication. Content analyses of media coverage of COVID-19 preprints have found that news reports seldom define the term preprint and that, when they do, those definitions are often brief and superficial (Fleerackers, Riedlinger et al., 2022; Massarani &amp; Neves, 2022; Van Schalkwyk &amp; Dudek, 2022). Potentially, this trend reflects an assumption among journalists that public audiences would not understand the information or find it useful (Fleerackers, Moorhead et al., 2022). Although public audiences seem to have limited understanding or familiarity with preprints and the broader peer-review process (Citation withheld; Ratcliff et al., 2024; Wingen et al., 2022), the findings of this study and those of Wingen et al. (2022) suggest that most individuals do notice and evaluate descriptors of preprint status when some explanation is provided for context. However, mentioning preprint status without interpretive cues or explanations is unlikely to have any impact (Wingen et al., 2022).\\n\\nOur observation of positive effects of conveying preprint status is preliminary and should be replicated, yet it has theoretical grounding. A majority of the public sees science as iterative (National Science Board, 2022) and reports being open to learning about tentative science and the caveats and limitations of research (Ratcliff et al., 2023). Therefore, transparent disclosures about the state of scientific evidence, including its (un)peer-reviewed status, should\\u2014when noticed\\u2014enhance source credibility. As the field works to translate broad frameworks of scientific uncertainty communication (e.g., Ratcliff &amp; Wicke, 2023; Van der Bles et al., 2019) into concrete, testable theories, our findings suggest it makes sense to include perceptions of disclosure and of scientific uncertainty as mediators in these models. Further research to examine which factors influence these perceptions will also be valuable.\\n\\n\",\n          \"## 1. Introduction\\n\\n\\nThe use of nationwide high-stakes testing, which relies on standardized test scores for admission, has increased in many countries (Furuta et al. 2021; H\\u00f6gberg and Horn 2022; Verger et al. 2019), especially in admissions to selective institutions. Although the high-stakes entrance exam system has not been implemented widely in US education, admissions to several selective public schools (often called magnet schools ), such as New York City's Specialized High Schools, tend to use high-stakes testing. While high-stakes testing is characterized by its objectivity and transparency, there has been ongoing controversy over the equity of access and diversity of the student body (Corcoran and Baker-Smith 2018). In this context, it is critically important to examine whether and how the use of high-stakes testing improves, maintains, or even exacerbates preexisting inequality in access to elite education.\\n\\nA sizable number of previous studies have examined the role of high-stakes testing for class inequality or race/ethnicity diversity (Buchmann et al. 2010; Grodsky et al. 2008; SattinBajaj and Roda 2020; Vigdor and Clotfelter 2003), but relatively few studies have investigated its potential consequence for gender inequality in access to selective institutions. This is surprising because women's underrepresentation in selective colleges  is still the case in many 1 countries, including the United States (Bielby et al. 2014; Buchmann et al. 2010). Because attending selective colleges has a number of socioeconomic advantages (see, e.g., Gerber and Cheung 2008; Hout 2012; Hoxby 2009 for reviews), especially for women (Ge et al. 2022), it is critical to consider how the high-stakes exam may shape the underrepresentation of women in selective institutions (Corcoran and Baker-Smith 2018), with potential implications for reducing gender inequality.\\n\\nWhy are there few women in selective colleges? How does the exam setting play a role? Some studies suggest its connection to the risk of exam failure. Since admission to these selective colleges is competitive, a sizable number of applicants fail admission in this testing system in the absence of a properly designed matching system based on scores. This is especially the case when a student can only apply to a limited number of schools. In such admission systems, students often miscalculate their likelihood of admission and end up spending an additional uncertain year to retake the exam. Interestingly, studies have reported that there is a significant gender gap in exam-retaking for selective college applications (Kang et al. 2021; Landaud and Maurin 2020; Yu 2009), suggesting that the gender gap in exam-retaking is an important source of gender stratification in countries that rely upon high-stakes exams. However, a plausible mechanism to explain the gender gap in exam-retaking is still unclear.\\n\\nThis study examines how meritocratic selection in the transition from upper-secondary to higher education contributes to the persistence of women's 'leaky pipeline' to selective colleges. Specifically, I aim to advance the literature on women's underrepresentation in selective educational institutions in three ways. First, I provide descriptive evidence that women are significantly less likely to retake the exam when they fail; this is an important factor in explaining the gender gap in attending a selective college. Second, drawing upon previous studies that examined explanations for gender gaps in higher education, I assess three explanations for the gender gap in exam-retaking, including gender gaps in (1) students' aspirations, (2) parents' educational expectations, and (3) psychological attitudes relevant to competitive environments (e.g., ambitions and confidence). Third, I analyze whether men and women respond to the risk of exam failure and the uncertainty of exam-retaking differently net of compositional differences in these traits. As an interesting case of potentially broader\\n\\nrelevance to other societies, the current study examines Japan, where (1) many high schoolers fail to pass the high-stakes entrance exams for selective colleges (defined as national and public universities) and often retake the exam the following year, (2) parents' financial support to attend a selective college is critical because of the considerably limited public spending on higher education and the heavy emphasis on shadow education, and, importantly, (3) only one in five undergraduate students in the nation's top university are women despite the gender gap convergence in overall college attendance (Rich 2019; Schubert and Marinica 2018). 2\\n\\nThis study provides important insights into potentially unintended consequences of the recent educational reforms that increasingly emphasize the high-stakes exams in school admissions (Furuta et al. 2021). In a sense, objectively measured test scores could be 'open doors for the talented poor' (Cronbach 1975), and exam-retaking may be a fair system because it allows applicants who are willing to attend their desired school to attempt a second try, although sociologists have also criticized standardized testing as a gatekeeper that reproduces preexisting social inequality (Alon and Tienda 2007). Studies with mixed arguments regarding the power of high-stakes exams in the United States, for example, have examined the role of standardized tests (e.g., the SAT) in relation to class origin or race/ethnicity (Buchmann et al. 2010; Grodsky et al. 2008; Vigdor and Clotfelter 2003). This study adds another aspect, namely, gender, by arguing that the high-stakes exams may exacerbate gender inequality in some education contexts, including but not limited to Japan, where the emphasis on parents' role in children's school choice and fewer admission opportunities for selective institutions may reproduce the existing gender inequality in selective college attendance.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Background\\n\\n\\nImportance of horizontal stratification in higher education for gender inequality\\n\\nReflecting the cooccurrence of college expansion and the growth of institutional heterogeneity through the proliferation of lower-tier institutions (Arum et al. 2007) and the increased competitiveness of selective colleges (Bound et al. 2009; Hoxby 2009), scholars have increasingly paid attention to how qualitative aspects of higher education play a role in status attainment. Prior work has focused on selective colleges to examine heterogeneity within higher education in terms of labor market returns to higher education (Astin and Oseguera 2004; Brand and Halaby 2006; Brewer et al. 1999; Chetty et al. 2020; Ge et al. 2022; Haveman and Smeeding 2006; James et al. 1989; Karen 2002; Sekhri 2020; Thomas 2003; Thomas and Zhang 2005). Attending selective institutions provides students with social networks or access to relationships with recruiters from elite firms (Domina et al. 2017) or elite clubs (Khan 2011; Michelman et al. 2021), which can be transformed into economic returns via employment in highly rewarding occupations.\\n\\nIn light of the abundant evidence that attending selective colleges provides many advantages, especially for women (Ge et al. 2022), women's underrepresentation in these institutions may be an important mechanism that potentially explains gender inequality in the labor market. Indeed, women's underrepresentation in selective institutions varies to a great degree across countries. Elite schools in English-speaking countries (Ivy Leagues in the US and Oxbridge in the UK), for example, achieve gender parity;  more women than men are enrolled in 3\\n\\nNordic, Dutch, and Irish top universities;  and fewer female undergraduate students than male 4 students are enrolled in other top universities in Switzerland and East Asia.  Against this 5 backdrop, it is surprising that almost no studies have investigated the sources that could potentially explain the cross-national variation in women's underrepresentation in selective institutions and its consequences.\\n\\n\\n## Potential mechanisms for gender difference in selective colleges\\n\\n\\nIn this study, I examine two potential mechanisms that explain the difference in outcomes for multiple groups, one focusing on compositional differences in characteristics relevant to exam-retaking and the other on different behavioral responses for men and women. Based on this approach, this section briefly reviews the explanations for why fewer women than men retake the exam and are hence less likely to be enrolled in selective institutions.\\n\\n\\n## Compositional differences in individual characteristics\\n\\n\\nIf some traits (e.g., academic aspirations) are associated with attending a selective college through exam-retaking and the distribution of these traits differs for men and women, this distributional difference may account for the gender difference in selective college attendance. In this study, I discuss three traits, namely, gender gaps in (1) academic aspirations, (2) parents' educational expectations, and (3) psychological attitudes relevant to competitive environments.\\n\\nFirst, one aspect that potentially explains the gender gap in selective college attendance via exam-retaking is the gender gap in aspirations. Studies have shown that, for example, there is a robust relationship between educational aspirations or expectations and attainment (Kao and Tienda 1998; Marini and Greenberger 1978; Pinquart Ebeling 2020). While there was a gender gap in such aspirations in the past (Marini and Greenberger 1978), it has been reduced to a negligible degree in the United States (Watt et al., 2012). Convergence in male and female children's educational aspirations is also the case in Japan (Ojima and Aramaki 2018).\\n\\nAlthough the gender gap in children's educational aspirations in terms of educational levels has diminished, no studies have reported whether aspirations for selective colleges differ by gender among those who aim to attend college. If women are less likely to aim to attend a selective college than men, this may explain the gender difference in exam-retaking. Additionally, there is good reason to believe that this reflects a gender difference in expected returns to selective college attendance (Heckert et al. 2002; Hogue et al. 2010; Smith and Powell 1990). As I discuss in more detail below, this could be the case especially for the Japanese context, where attending a selective college typically leads graduates to large firms (Hirasawa 2010; Ishida 1998; Yoshida 2020), but the working conditions in these firms, including long work hours and frequent relocation to other regions (JILPT 2016; MHLW 2022), often prevent women from continuing their employment after marriage and childbearing.\\n\\nSecond, in contrast to the convergence of children's educational aspirations, at least at vertical levels, parents still tend to have lower expectations for female children than for male children (Holloway 2010; Ojima and Aramaki 2018; Yamamoto 2014). Parents' role is particularly relevant to the Japanese context, where public spending on higher education is considerably limited (Brinton 1993; Nakazawa 2016). The lack of public spending results in\\n\\nchildren's heavy reliance on parents' financial support to attend a higher education institution.\\n\\nParents' role is further emphasized for admission to selective colleges because parents' investment in shadow education, including sending their children to a prep school when they retake the exam, is critical for success in meritocratic selection through high-stakes exams (Stevenson and Baker 1992).\\n\\nFinally, in addition to these well-known predictors of aiming for selective colleges, a few studies have discussed the importance of the psychological factors that shape gender differences in participation in elite education. Scholars have paid particular attention to the role of preference for competition and self-confidence. In general, women are less likely to prefer a competitive environment (Gneezy et al. 2003; Niederle and Vesterlund 2007; 2011) and more likely to be risk averse (e.g., Cohen and Einav 2007; Eckel and Grossman 2008; Eckel et al. 2009; but see Nelson 2016), and women tend to report lower confidence or self-esteem than men (Beyer 1990; Beyer and Bowden 1997; Ehrlinger and Dunning 2003; Soll and Kalyman 2004; van Houtte 2005) and to be less ambitious (Eagly and Karau 2002; Fox and Lawless 2014).\\n\\nPsychological attitudes relevant to competition (e.g., risk-taking, ambition, or confidence) are important because the meritocratic selection in most contemporary societies is more or less characterized by a heavy emphasis on standardized test scores under pressure and thus is detrimental to students' mental health (H\\u00f6gberg and Horn 2022). Indeed, studies have argued that competitive high-stakes exams often favor men over women (Azmat et al. 2016; Bielby et al. 2014; Niederle and Vesterlund 2010; Ors et al. 2013; Shurchkov 2012). For example, a few observational studies report that women are more likely to report test anxiety than men (N\\u00fa\\u00f1ezPe\\u00f1a et al. 2016; Putwain and Daly 2014), which may lead to women's underperformance in competitive exam settings (Jurajda and M\\u00fcnich 2011; Ors et al. 2013; Price 2008).\\n\\nSince admission to higher education is based on meritocratic selection, one may wonder whether gender differences in elite education could plausibly be due to an ability difference by gender. Studies have shown that the gender gap in academic ability is an important mechanism for explaining the gender gap in selective colleges, but they also suggest that this depends on measurement. According to these studies, women and men do not differ in their cognitive ability (Halpern 2011). Women tend to perform better in grades (Spinath et al. 2014), but their standardized test scores tend to be lower than those of male students (Duckworth and Seligman 2006), especially math test scores (OECD 2019),  suggesting that each measurement captures 6 different aspects of academic performance (DiPrete and Buchmann 2013). 7\\n\\n\\n## Different behavioral responses\\n\\n\\nAnother perspective posits that women and men with the similar characteristics discussed above may behave differently, resulting in gender differences in selective college attendance. Specifically, even if men and women have similar academic aspirations or competition-relevant psychological traits, they may be treated differently by someone who is responsible for decisionmaking regarding their school choice.\\n\\nIn this line of research, abundant studies have revealed that men and women are not treated equally by their parents or teachers (Gunderson et al. 2012). In the context of the lack of female students majoring in STEM fields, for example, studies have argued that parents with gender stereotypic attitudes tend to have favorable views of their sons', but not their daughters',\\n\\nmath ability (Gunderson et al. 2012; Jacobs and Eccles 1992). Studies have shown that teachers also tend to perceive men's math or science competencies more favorably than those of women (Moss-Racusin et al. 2012; Riegle-Crumb and Humphries 2012). Children or students may be discouraged from aiming high due to sex-based preferences for educational investment or expectations that attending selective colleges may not help women's socioeconomic achievement (Brinton 1993; Yu 2009). If this is true, the likelihood of exam-retaking may differ even for men and women with similar traits relevant to selective college attendance.\\n\\n\\n## Japanese context\\n\\n\\nSince Japanese education and admission systems are quite distinctive compared with those in other rich countries, such as the United States, this section reviews their basic structure. For the sake of brevity, I limit the explanations to those relevant to my research question and hypotheses. Secondary and tertiary education in Japan\\n\\nSecondary education in Japan is characterized by comprehensive education at the lower level (from 7 th to 9 th grades) and hierarchical academic ranking at the upper level (from 10 th to 12 th grades). The former is similar to secondary education in other countries (e.g., the United States), while the latter is distinctive in the sense that high schools are differentiated according to their academic selectivity (Rohlen 1983). Junior high school students are sorted into high schools with different selectivity depending on their academic ability, measured by the entrance exam organized by each high school. Importantly, the school hierarchy is widely shared among people (LeTendre et al. 2003), at least among those who live in the local areas. As such, Japan's distinctiveness in upper secondary education is characterized by between-school tracking, as opposed to US secondary education, where students are sorted within schools depending on their\\n\\nacademic ability. As a result, it is often the case that the large majority of students in selective high schools apply to and enter four-year universities.\\n\\nAccording to the comparative education policy literature, admission systems across countries are classified into several models, namely, secondary leaving exams, entrance exams, aptitude tests, and no exam (Helms 2009; Reshetar and Pitts 2020). Admission in Japanese secondary and tertiary education, as in other East Asian countries, belongs to the group of entrance exams, where students are evaluated objectively solely by test scores, most notably, high-stakes exams for high school and college admissions. Studies suggest that such admission systems have mixed consequences for students' well-being. On the one hand, the competitive environments pay because their ranking in high school predicts students' probability of attending elite colleges net of student ability (Kariya and Rosembaum 1987; Ono 2001), which in turn leads to economic returns in the labor market, including higher earnings (Ono 2004; 2007), employment in large firms (Hirasawa 2010; Ishida 1998; Yoshida 2020), access to managerial positions (Ishida et al. 1997),  or even returns in the marriage market (Uchikoshi and Raymo 8 2021). On the other hand, students are under high pressure in such high-stakes exams, which may increase students' emotional stress (H\\u00f6gberg and Horn 2022); previous studies have criticized the negative side of this admission system as 'exam hell' (Kariya and Rosenbaum 2003; Rohlen 1983). The stressful environment could be more detrimental to women's willingness and ability to apply to and attend elite institutions.\\n\\nAdmission system in Japanese higher education\\n\\nAlthough between-school tracking is critical in shaping opportunities for attending selective colleges (Kariya and Rosembaum 1987; Ono 2001), it is important to note that not all students in these selective high schools are admitted to selective colleges without interruption. Rather, high school students often fail the entrance exam and take the same exam the next year; these students are called Ronin (examination repeaters, literally masterless samurai) (Zeng 1999).\\n\\nThis is an important informal educational track for selective colleges and later labor market success because these students spend a whole year exclusively on the entrance exam, typically attending a prep school for university admission ( Yobiko ) (Tsukada 1991). Therefore, one year of Ronin experience increases their chances of being admitted to selective universities (Nishimaru 2006; Ono 2007), and by attending selective colleges, exam repeaters tend to enjoy better socioeconomic attainment in later life (Ono 2007). For this reason, exam-retaking pays off in Japan. For example, in the late 20 th century, one in three four-year university students had at least one year of Ronin experience; importantly, the proportion of Ronin students is larger for selective (=national and public) universities than less selective (=private) universities (see Appendix Figure 2). 9\\n\\nStudents fail the exam for several reasons. A proximate cause is that a sizable number of students who are as competitive candidates as high schoolers also failed the exam in previous years. Against this backdrop, one may wonder why students fail the entrance exams because available seats (enrollments) are scarce but, importantly, the acceptance rate to universities was already high during the 1990s (above 50%). Currently, some low-ranked universities have adopted a de facto open admission where students are accepted without admission if they apply.\\n\\nThis means that students do not have to spend an additional year as Ronin . Takeuchi (1997: 185) explains that a sizable number of high schoolers still fail the exam and spend an additional year retaking the exam. This is especially the case for selective institutions 10 because the explicit university ranking, which is measured by the standardized score based on the mock exam by testing companies ( Hensachi ), 11 encourages students to aim for a university 'one rank higher than the one he or she is confident of entering.'\\n\\nAt the institutional level, many applicants fail the exam, especially for national and public universities, which are often perceived to be more prestigious, more selective, and of better quality (Ishida 1998; Ono 2008), because admission windows are controlled by the Ministry of Education and windows for these universities are extremely limited (only one or two windows). 12 This is enough to make students feel stressed, but admission to these national/public institutions often uses two-stage screening in which students are required to take a nationwide standardized test as a first stage and, after the nationwide exam, apply to each school they aim to enter and take the second exam coordinated by each university. Most selective schools typically establish a cutoff based on the score of the nationwide exam, so it is critical for students to carefully choose and apply to schools with a threshold lower than their score on the nationwide entrance exam.\\n\\nIn contrast, private universities, most of which are in the lower ranks of the selectivity hierarchy (with a few notable, widely recognized exceptions), admit prospective students by\\n\\nusing exams they design rather than the nationwide test; thus, they usually have a wide range of admission windows without multi-screening processes. Additionally, compared with the strict time window for national/public universities, private universities have more admission windows, so applicants can take an exam for the same school multiple times. Moreover, their exams are conducted earlier than the nationwide test.\\n\\nBased on the difference in the academic hierarchy for these two types of institutions and the high probability of miscalculation due to the limited number of admission opportunities, students typically take entrance exams for private universities as a backup, followed by exams for national/public universities. Indeed, applying to both national/public and private universities even if students' first choice is the former is a strategy often suggested by high schools, which have incentives to lower the risk of students spending an additional year as Ronin (JILPT 2017). How exam-retaking may reinforce gender inequality in selective college attendance\\n\\nAlthough the admission structure is gender-neutral by nature, there are good reasons to believe that the distinctive structure in Japanese higher education described above plays a critical role in explaining women's underrepresentation in selective institutions. On the one hand, the highly stressful and uncertain environment in admission to selective colleges suggests that admission systems characterized by high-stakes exams may penalize those who prefer less competition, are more risk averse, and report less confidence in their ability. If these traits differ for men and women on average, which seems to be the case in Japan (Mizutani et al. 2009), the high-stakes exam could be an important driver of women's underrepresentation in selective institutions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, women's lower likelihood of spending an additional year as Ronin could partly be due to women's lower expected return to (elite) education (Heckert et al. 2002;\\n\\nHogue et al. 2010; Smith and Powell 1990). Although I use students' aspirations for selective college attendance as a proxy of the expected return and deal with this possibility by comparing the results for the entire sample and the sample limited to those who aim for selective colleges in the early years of high school, their perceived economic return for attending a selective college is still not measured. Even when the sample is limited to those who likely have higher expected returns, parents (and/or teachers) may have different expectations of women's and men's educational attainment. As Yu (2009: 171) notes, 'The importance of individuals' educational aspirations and their family's expectations for them, independent of their abilities, also rose with Japan's adoption of a two-stage exam system' under national universities' admission policy that forces applicants (and their parents) to think carefully about 'how undesirable their situation will be if they fail. Japanese men and women are likely to have different answers to these questions.' Specifically, Yu (2009) argues that, although not directly examined, parents are less likely to support their daughters' exam-retaking. If this is the case, even men and women with similar characteristics relevant to exam-retaking may have different responses to the potential risk of exam failure. Parents' expectations may differ for sons and daughters, which may also explain the gender gap in exam-retaking.\\n\\n\\n## 3. Research questions and hypotheses\\n\\n\\nThe literature review above suggests that the macrolevel admission system in higher education is a critical source of the gender gap in access to selective colleges in Japan and, in turn, the significant gender gap in the labor market. While the Japanese admission system belongs to the group of high-stakes exams from a comparative perspective, its admission system, especially for national and public universities, is distinctive in the sense that students often need\\n\\nto take two high-stakes exams to get into these universities. Importantly, students must choose schools they apply to by themselves based on the first nationwide test score. If they are not admitted, then they might spend another year to make it to the national/public university. Therefore, those who prefer not to retake the exam for various reasons or who are simply good at calculating their likelihood of admission are likely to lower their goal and apply to the secondbest school for them. Alternatively, even if they intend to attend national/public universities at an earlier point in time in high school, they could shift their goal to private universities, which typically have more admission opportunities, including multiple entrance exams and admissions not based on the high-stakes exam (Yoshihara 1998). 13\\n\\nAs such, previous studies have argued that women are more likely to be admitted to universities without taking the high-stakes exam (Yoshihara 1998) and are less likely to retake the exam (Stevenson and Baker 1992; Yoshihara 1998); however, the focus of these studies was on college attendance in general and did not pay specific attention to selective colleges. In contrast to these studies, this study pays explicit attention to the 'leaky pipeline' into selective colleges as a potential explanation for the gender gap in selective institutions by focusing on the gender difference in exam-retaking. Specifically, I examine whether women are less likely to retake the exam than men even if they reported they were interested in attending national or\\n\\npublic universities in their early stage of high school. The educational aspirations among students who choose to retake the exam are heterogeneous, but a majority of these students aim for a national or public university in their third year of high school. Unlike earlier studies (Stevenson and Baker 1992; Yu 2009), this study is the first to pay explicit attention to the mechanisms of the gender difference in exam-retaking.\\n\\nBased on the literature review, I examine the following hypotheses. First, I examine whether the compositional difference, if any, in academic aspirations, parental expectations, or psychological characteristics for men and women accounts for the difference in exam-retaking for the two groups. To answer this question, Hypothesis 1 tests the following relationship. Hypothesis 1a: Students with lower academic aspirations are less likely to retake the exam. Hypothesis 1b: Students whose parents have lower educational expectations are less likely to retake the exam.\\n\\nHypothesis 1c: Students with lower confidence or ambition are less likely to retake the exam.\\n\\nIf women are more likely than men to have these characteristics, this could at least partially explain women's underrepresentation in selective institutions in Japan. I also expect that parents tend to have higher expectations for their sons' education than their daughters' education. The distributional difference in parental expectations is likely to explain the gender gap in examretaking.\\n\\nNext, I hypothesize that men and women may have different experiences even though they have similar characteristics (e.g., academic aspirations and psychological attitudes). A posited mechanism is that women are discouraged by parents or teachers to aim high even though they are equally qualified to attend a selective college. Specifically, I hypothesize that the gender gap in exam-retaking is much larger for those who have individual traits that are\\n\\npositively correlated with exam-retaking (more academic aspirations, more ambition or confidence).\\n\\nHypothesis 2: The positive association between exam-retaking and academic aspirations, confidence, or ambition is suppressed for women.\\n\\n\\n## 4. Data, variables, and method\\n\\n\\nData\\n\\nTo answer the research questions discussed above, I use the Japanese Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents conducted by the Benesse Educational Research and Development Institute and the Institute of Social Science at the University of Tokyo. This is a nationally representative survey targeting school-age children from 6 to 18 and their parents or guardians. The initial wave was conducted in September 2015, with a follow-up survey every year until the children graduated from high school. For high school students, the survey asked about their educational aspiration or first-choice school after graduating from high school, including whether the desired college was national, public, or private, as well as other relevant questions including their school grades. When students graduated from high school, an additional survey questionnaire was sent to them asking about their plan after school graduation (e.g., whether they would attend a university or spend an additional year as Ronin ). In this study, I used the four publicly available waves of the survey (2015 to 2018) and limited the sample to those who answered the school graduation survey. After omitting missing cases for the outcome variable, 1,494 cases remained. I employed multiple imputations by iterative chained equations (MICE) to create 10 imputed datasets to address the missing data. The descriptive table can be found in Appendix Table 1.\\n\\n## Variables\\n\\nIn this study, I define selective colleges as national and public four-year universities. Although I am aware of the sizable variation within these institutions in terms of selectivity, 14 one theoretical rationale for the definition, in addition to the data limitation that the name of the school they attended is not publicly available, is that most selective universities (e.g., the former imperial universities such as the University of Tokyo or Kyoto University) are located in urban rather than rural areas. Therefore, limiting the selective colleges to a few very selective ones in my analysis may add another complication. Specifically, studies have shown that women are less likely to leave their parental homes in the transition from high school to college (Higeta 2020). In contrast, defining selective colleges as national and public universities is less affected by geography because these universities are located in all prefectures. 15\\n\\nTo test Hypothesis 1, I first utilized two educational aspirations of students. The first involves measuring aspirations for vertical levels of education (how far students want to go in terms of educational attainment). I converged the categorical measure to years of education, ranging from 12 (high school education) to 18 (graduate education). The other involved measuring aspirations for horizontal levels of education. Specifically, I used the question asking students about the extent to which they wanted to enter a competitive university. This question was asked of all students regardless of whether they aimed for a university. Additionally, I\\n\\nconstructed an index that measured parents' expectations for their children's education based on three variables. To avoid the possibility that the parental attitude was endogenous to their children's psychological attitude, I only used parental expectation measured in students' 1 st and 2 nd year of high school. Finally, I constructed two psychological attitudes (ambition and confidence). The variables used to create the indexes are shown in Appendix Table 2. After standardizing all attitudinal variables, I summarized them and standardized them again.\\n\\nSince parental socioeconomic status likely influences the availability of exam-retaking, I included household income and the number of children reported by parents. I also included students' preference for STEM subjects because admissions for non-STEM departments in private universities typically do not require students to take STEM subjects, whereas most national and public universities do, at least for the nationwide exam. This approach considers and controls the possibility that women are more likely to shift to private universities because of their weaker preference for STEM subjects. I also use the nationwide mock exam score reported by students to control for students' academic ability (as of September in their senior year). 16\\n\\n## Method\\n\\nTo estimate the impact of psychological traits and parental expectations on exam-retaking and how they differ by gender, I estimate the following OLS regressions (essentially, linear probability models). First, in Model 1, I estimate models of the form where the outcome is examretaking compared with other plans after school graduation, regressed on student's gender (female dummy). To control for the potential gender difference in academic ability or other\\n\\nunobserved characteristics, Model 2 adds covariates such as the nationwide mock test results prior to the high-stakes exam, preference for STEM subjects, and parental education.\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nIn Model 3, I add two academic aspirations. Model 4 further adds parental expectations, while Model 5 adds two psychological variables (ambition and confidence). All of these variables are added to Model 6 as follows.\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nFinally, I add interaction variables between these traits and the female dummy if the variable shows a statistically significant relationship with the outcome at baseline. Suppose academic aspirations are significant:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nTo deal with missing data, I employ multiple imputations by iterative chained equations (MICE) to create 10 imputed datasets (Royston and White 2011). See Appendix Figure 3 for a comparison of the observational and imputed data. The statistical results are robust to different imputation models.\\n\\n\\n## 5. Results\\n\\n\\n\\n## Descriptive results\\n\\n\\n\\n## Trajectories of educational aspirations and admission outcomes\\n\\n\\nFigure 1 presents the trajectories of male and female high school students' educational aspirations and outcomes. The first three bars from the left show their aspirations, including educational levels (whether they aim for a university or not) and horizontal stratification in university education (whether they aim for a national/public or private university or are undecided). The fourth bar shows their admission outcome reported in the last month of their senior year.\\n\\nThis figure clearly shows that high school students' aspirations are relatively stable, but not all of them realize their aspirations in actual outcomes. For example, a majority of men and women who plan to enter a national or public university in their 2nd or 3rd year also stated the same preference one year earlier. We also see that a fraction of students have not decided whether they aim to enter a national/public or private university in their 1st year, but most of them eventually plan to aim for a private university, which suggests that those who aim for a national or public university decide their first-choice school relatively earlier than those who aim for a private university. This result makes sense in the Japanese higher education admission context, where applicants for national/public universities tend to take more subjects than those for private universities, so they are more likely to start preparing for the exam earlier.\\n\\nWe can also see that there is a sizable gender gap in exam-retaking. Close to one in five men (19%) spend another year preparing for the entrance exam, while fewer than 6% of women do the same. For both men (74%) and women (64%), a majority of exam retakers aimed for a national or public university in their senior year, suggesting that the vast majority of them failed\\n\\nthe entrance exam for national or public universities and were likely to retake the entrance exam for these universities in the following year. Interestingly, there is no major gender difference in attending a national or public university upon high school graduation (19% for men and 18% for women). Since one year of exam-retaking experience increases students' chance of entering a selective college (Nishimaru 2006; Ono 2007), this result suggests that exam-retaking is likely an important mechanism explaining the gender gap in selective institutions in Japan.\\n\\n## [Figure 1]\\n\\n\\n## Distributional differences in psychological attitudes and other variables\\n\\n\\nThe distribution of key predictor variables used in this study separately by gender is shown in Figure 2 (STEM preference and the mock test result are shown for reference). The gender differences are mostly in line with my expectations. For example, men tend to report more educational aspirations than women do, measured at both vertical and horizontal levels. The parental expectation for children's education is also higher for sons than daughters. Additionally, consistent with my expectation, men are more ambitious or confident than women. These gender differences, however, are relatively smaller than the gender difference in STEM preferences. In contrast, we do not see a major difference in the mock test result, suggesting that women's academic ability is comparable to that of men in my analytical sample.\\n\\nThe earlier descriptive figures are consistent with my theoretical expectations. Possibly reflecting women's lower educational expectations or their lower confidence in their ability and ambition, they may be more likely to switch to apply to less selective institutions and less likely to retake the exam when they fail. An important assumption is that, conditional on another assumption that the variables constructed here reflect such traits, these mechanisms can\\n\\npotentially explain the gender gap in selective institutions net of academic ability. It could also be the case that none of the distributional differences explains the gender gap in exam-retaking. Instead, men and women with similar characteristics may respond differently to the outcome. In the subsequent section, I examine whether the observed relationship is explained, at least partially, by considering the gender difference in these traits as well as whether the relationship still holds even after considering other potential confounders.\\n\\n## [Figure 2]\\n\\n\\n## Multivariate results\\n\\n\\nTable 1 presents the results of OLS regression models predicting whether students plan to retake the entrance exam (a full table can be found in Appendix Table 3). In this analysis, I focus on exam-retaking as the main outcome since descriptive figures show that this is the source of the major gender difference.\\n\\nThe results clearly show that even after controlling for covariates in Model 2, women are less likely to choose to spend another year as Ronin to retake the exam. Specifically, Model 1 shows that female students are 13.7% less likely to spend another year on exam-retaking than male students. This relationship holds after controlling for covariates in Model 2.\\n\\nFrom Models 3 to 5, I add key variables that explain the gender gap in exam-retaking. Since all of these measures are standardized, we can compare the effect sizes. By and large, adding these variables attenuates the negative coefficients of the female dummy, which is consistent with Hypothesis 1. In Model 3, students' aspirations for attending a selective college, not educational aspirations measured as years of education, are positively associated with the likelihood of exam-retaking. This result makes sense since exam-retaking is typically done by\\n\\nstudents who are already qualified to attend a college but who spend another year aiming for a more selective college. In Model 4, parental expectations are also positively associated with exam-retaking. Finally, in Model 5, one psychological attitude (ambition) is positively associated with exam-retaking. Another trait, confidence, is negatively correlated with exam-retaking, but the coefficient is not statistically significant. In terms of magnitude, selective college aspirations are most strongly associated with exam-retaking. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in attitude is associated with a 6.3% increase in the likelihood of exam-retaking.\\n\\nIn Model 6, I add these five variables. According to this model, only selective college aspirations are positively associated with exam-retaking. Effect sizes for parents' educational expectations and ambitions are attenuated after controlling for other candidate variables. In contrast to the expectation of Hypothesis 1, this model suggests that parental expectations and psychological attitudes do not play a major role in explaining the gender difference in examretaking. These results are consistent with Hypothesis 1a, but the results do not support the hypotheses that parental expectations (Hypothesis 1b) or students' psychological characteristics (Hypothesis 1c) explain the gender difference in exam-retaking. Even though Hypothesis 1a is supported, the degree to which it accounts for the gender gap in exam-retaking is small (2.3%).\\n\\nAnother research question in this study is whether men and women with the same attitude respond to the outcome differently. Indeed, some studies suggest that women are discouraged from aiming high and retaking the exam (Yoshihara 1998). Although we cannot observe such social norms that treat men and women differently, an expectation is that women are discouraged from choosing this option regardless of their competitive attitudes toward entering selective colleges. To test this expectation, Model 7 adds an interaction between the female dummy and\\n\\nselective college aspirations, which shows a negative coefficient that is statistically significant at the 0.1% level.\\n\\nTo understand the gender difference in the impact of competition attitudes toward opting for exam-retaking, Figure 3 presents the predicted probability of retaking the exam with various selective college aspiration settings for men and women. For those who are less competitive in terms of their attitude toward selective colleges, there is no gender difference, while the gender gap increases with the competition index. Around one standard deviation of the index, the chance of exam-retaking differs by gender by approximately 20%. This result suggests that, consistent with Hypothesis 2, women with similar academic aspirations to attend a selective college as men tend to face normative pressure not to aim high or pressure to 'settle' for their second choice to avoid exam-retaking.\\n\\n[Table 1]\\n\\n[Figure 3]\\n\\n\\n## 6. Supplementary analysis\\n\\n\\nThe results shown above were based on the sample who entered a college or who would retake the exam. Although I assume that retaking the exam increases their chance to enter a selective college in the following year, this 'casting a wider net' approach may include a group of the population who are less qualified to attend a selective college even after spending another year. To compare 'apples and apples' (i.e., students with similar academic potential), I therefore conduct a supplementary analysis by limiting the sample to students who stated their interest in attending a selective college (national or public university) in their 3 rd of high school, with the\\n\\nassumption that this is correlated with academic potential. 17 If the results are comparable between the samples based on the wider or narrower definition, we can speculate that the same mechanism is at work in diverging men's and women's educational trajectories regardless of their academic potential.\\n\\nAppendix Table 4 and Figure 3 summarize the results. I perform the same regression analyses. Note that children's educational expectations are omitted since by definition all students in this analytical sample are aiming for a college. Table 4 suggests that the substantive results are comparable to the results based on the full sample. Specifically, parental educational expectations and psychological traits relevant to the competitive environment are not associated with students' chance of retaking the exam. Similar to the earlier results, I also find that the interaction coefficient for the female dummy and children's aspirations for a selective college is negative and statistically significant. Appendix Figure 3 presents the predicted probability of exam-retaking by gender and students' selective college aspirations. Consistent with what we observed in Figure 2, the positive association between aspirations to attend a selective college and students' likelihood of retaking the exam is suppressed for women.\\n\\n\\n## 7. Discussion and conclusion\\n\\n\\nIn this paper, I tested several potential mechanisms that help in understanding gender inequality in Japanese higher education, which is characterized by an extremely low number of female students in selective institutions. The results of the analysis show the following findings. First, net of academic ability measured as the nationwide mock exam result, a good proxy of\\n\\ncollege selectivity in Japan, women are less likely to choose to retake the exam. Second, the gender gap in exam-retaking is partly explained by women's lower aspirations for selective college attendance, which may reflect women's lower expected returns for attending a selective college. However, the size of the variation explained is small. I also found that parents' expectations and psychological characteristics relevant to admissions to selective universities, such as confidence or ambitions, do not account for the gender difference. Third, and most interestingly, I found that the positive association between aspirations for selective college attendance and exam-retaking was significantly reduced for women.\\n\\nThis study made an explicit case selection by choosing the Japanese case, an extreme outlier in comparative perspective in terms of women's representation in selective higher education. What can we learn from this single case study? Women's lower confidence or ambitions have been well documented across countries (Niederle and Vesterlund 2011). This situation may be even worse in Japan, which is characterized by persistent gender inequality in the labor market and gender-specific socialization at home. However, the lack of evidence supporting the explanatory power of these psychological characteristics needs an alternative explanation for why few women aim for a selective college net of academic ability and these psychological characteristics.\\n\\nOne important insight suggested by the analysis is that social norms may treat individuals with the same aspirations differently based on their ascribed trait, namely, gender. Although still suggestive, the results indicate that academic aspirations are institutionalized in the transition from secondary to higher education in the sense that students' attitudes are evaluated in a gendered way. Theoretically, exam-retaking should not occur in contemporary Japan because the number of applicants to universities is almost the same as the capacity of universities, but in\\n\\nreality, a sizable number of high school students end up spending an additional year. This happens because the admission opportunities for selective institutions are considerably limited, and students must take a risk in making it to their dream school or failing. In this context, examretaking offers an informal means for a second try, but the results indicate that men and women do not enjoy the opportunity equally. Even if women have academic aspirations that are equally competitive with those of men, their aspirations may be evaluated differently by their parents or teachers. These results provide important insights into why gender inequality in attending a selective college has been stable despite the ongoing gender convergence in four-year university enrollment. Since attending a selective college is a pipeline to high-stakes positions in Japan (e.g., bureaucrats, researchers, and leadership positions in large firms), it is critical to further investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the gender gap in selective colleges for gender equality.\\n\\nThe case of Japan is an illustrative example that highlights this discouraging mechanism. This does not mean, however, that the implication is limited to Japan because high-stakes exams exist almost everywhere in contemporary societies (Furuta et al. 2021; H\\u00f6gberg and Horn 2022; Verger et al. 2019). For example, although the mechanisms are still unclear, the gender gap in admission and matriculation for New York City's Specialized High Schools, which is much larger than the gap between White and Black or Hispanic students, remains even after controlling for students' prior test scores (Corcoran and Baker-Smith 2018). As such, it is likely that we can find similar institutional mechanisms that unintentionally locate women in a less advantaged position, especially in gender inegalitarian contexts.\\n\\nIf correct, this speculation provides important social, economic, and political implications for gender equality. Despite the fact that women now outnumber men in higher education in\\n\\nmost rich countries (DiPrete and Buchmann 2013; van Bavel 2012), the gender gap in labor market outcomes remains substantial and has been stalled among college graduates (England 2010; Goldin 2014). A number of studies have suggested that fields of study may be a source of the gender pay gap (Zafar 2013) because women are less likely than men to specialize in fields associated with high-paying occupations, most notably STEM majors (Ceci and Williams 2011; Riegle-Crumb and Peng 2021; Weeden et al. 2020). Even after considering gender differences in fields of study, however, the gender pay gap remains (Kim et al. 2015; Zafar 2013). Although this is likely accounted for by gender differences in career interruption after family events, the remaining gender pay gap net of gender differences in fields of study among university graduates suggests that women's underrepresentation in selective institutions may be a critical source of gender stratification in the labor market.\\n\\nFuture studies need to identify causal mechanisms that can help us to understand what is happening during high school years and why more women than men are likely to drop out of the meritocratic competition for selective colleges even if they are equally qualified in terms of their academic achievements and aspirations. Specifically, the current data allow future studies to examine the detailed process, including whether students change their first choice in later years or use much safer admissions, by which men and women with similar academic aspirations diverge in their admission outcomes. These data would be more helpful if they collected rich information about individuals' risk preferences, attitudes toward competition, or confidence in their ability. 18 If these attitudes are properly measured, we could explain the remaining gender difference in exam-retaking, which would allow us to distinguish the psychological explanation\\n\\nfrom a more structural explanation, including female students being discouraged regardless of their mindset. For future studies, it should also be noted that school climate, which is missing from experimental studies, is an important institutional mechanism that reinforces students' gender stereotypes (e.g., Nakanishi 1998). It is also necessary to expand the role of high-stakes exams under high pressure for gender inequality in selective higher education from a comparative perspective. Reflecting diverse views on what should be counted as merit and what is fair competition, there is a large between- and within-country variation in admissions (Michel and Pollard 2020). Although many countries increasingly use national-level high-stakes exams, these admission systems are also constrained by institutional path dependency and cultural norms in each country (Furuta et al. 2021; Zwick 2017; Wikstr\\u00f6m and Wikstr\\u00f6m 2020), leading to speculation that the comparative perspective on meritocratic selection may help in understanding women's underrepresentation in elite education across countries. I expect that the high-stakes exam penalizes women more or less, but this is open to empirical investigation. If we find consistent patterns, then education policymakers should consider how to reduce gender inequality due to the potential bias in admission systems.\\n\\n\",\n          \"## INTRODUCTION\\n\\n\\nIn post-2000, following the arrival of an era of new technology, some local and international award-winning  anime,  'manga'  and  their  associated  products  vigorously  spread  around  the world, contributing towards an increase in the number of fans of Japanese popular culture (JPC). This rising international popularity in JPC was also linked to academic and other views, e.g. Japan's Gross National Cool (McGray 2002), cultural odour (Iwabuchi 2002), soft power (Nye 2004), and became influential enough to attract sections of the Japanese government to consider utilizing this as a strategy for revitalizing Japan's economy and promoting the country to the\\n\\nrest of the world under the Cool Japan/Creative Industry Policy administered by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and other initiatives such as the public-private Cool Japan Fund.\\n\\nThis popularity also affected Japanese language education. In 2006, The Society for Teaching Japanese as a Foreign Language (Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Gakkai) held a symposium about using  JPC in Japanese language education. This was the first time in their history that they formally paid attention to how JPC could be used as learning and teaching materials in Japanese language education. The Japan Foundation's (JF) inclusion of 'interest in JPC products' in the list  of    'purposes  for  studying  Japanese  language'  for the  first  time  in  its  2009  survey  also symbolizes the rising connection between JPC and Japanese language education (The Japan Foundation 2011). Furthermore, it is also worth mentioning the JF's establishment of a website for learning Japanese using anime and 'manga', 'Japanese in anime and manga' in 2010, when the  Japanese  government  officially  identified  the  culture  industries  as  potential  areas  for economic  growth,  and  established  the  Creative  Industries  Promotion  Office  in  METI  to promote these industries.\\n\\nAlthough the formal attention paid to JPC in Japanese language education is a relatively recent development, grass-roots attempts of linking JPC and the Japanese language education have been practiced since as early as the late 1980s or even earlier. The global boom in the late 1980s in learning the Japanese language, aligned with Japan's bubble economy, attracted many foreign  business  professionals  and  others  to  learn  the  language  for  their  current  and  future careers.  Looking  back  at  the  available  literature,  these  grass-roots  attempts  using  JPC  in Japanese language education were mainly practiced during that time but weakened with the burst of the bubble. As research into JPC in Japanese language education was yet to be formally established then, the ideas and practices connected to JPC, namely 'manga' and anime in these early days, and its relationship to Japanese language education at that time seem to have been buried under the larger wave of the JPC boom in post-2000. This article therefore aims to retrace a  history  of  JPC  in  Japanese  language  education  in  terms  of  ideas,  practices  and  research development to form a single trajectory of JPC in Japanese language education to post 2000.\\n\\nThe article consists of two parts. The first part critically discusses the ideas and practices of JPC represented by 'manga' (and anime) in Japanese language education in the late 1980s to 1990s. The second part discusses JPC in Japanese language education through research into 'manga' (and anime) in this field mainly from the late 1990s to the 2010s.\\n\\nThere  are  two  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  before  proceeding.  First,  this  article mainly focuses on the role that 'manga' has played in Japanese language education. This is due\\n\\nto a paucity of published studies discussing the use of JPC products other than 'manga', such as anime, pop music, dramas, movies and commercial advertisements. Furthermore, we assume that the reason for not focusing on other JPC products in the early days was due to restricted technology upon which many of them heavily rely for their distribution. 'Manga', on the other hand,  is  an  originally  printed  medium,  portable  and  easy  to  access  without  any  special technology required. Moreover, it is ostensibly a multimodal entertainment with pictures and spoken  language.  These  factors  seemed  to  have  pushed  'manga'  to  become  a  leading  JPC product for the learning and teaching of Japanese language in the early days. Despite these reasons, whilst admitting the article's extensive focus on 'manga', our intention is to view JPC in general in terms of Japanese language education.\\n\\nSecond, the data that  we used are limited  to Japanese and North American sources. Considering  the  fact  that  globally  over  60  per  cent  of  the  institutions  that  teach  Japanese language and over 80 per cent of the learners of Japanese language are concentrated in Asia (The  Japan  Foundation  2017),  this  study  may  not  comprehensively  depict  'the'  complete history of JPC in Japanese language education. The reason why the study focuses on data in the two countries  is  solely  due  to  the  availability  of  access  to those  data  following  our  limited language  proficiency  in  Japanese  and  English, 1 and  the  difficulty  in  locating  pre-2000  data within Asia online. Further study into the complete history would require to be cooperatively conducted with scholars worldwide.\\n\\n\\n## JPC IN JAPANESE LANGUAGE EDUCATION IN THE LATE-1980S TO THE 1990S\\n\\n\\nThis first part discusses ideas linking JPC and Japanese language education and its practices during the  late-1980s to the  1990s  by  critically  reviewing  Japanese  language  textbooks  and periodicals published during this period. It particularly focuses on three periodicals Mangajin , Gekkan Nihongo and Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin.\\n\\n\\n## Beginnings\\n\\n\\nJapanese language education outside Japan began to grow significantly in the 1980s along with Japan's  upswing  economy.  According  to  the  JF Survey  Report  on  Japanese-Language Education Abroad (The Japanese Foundation 1981, 1987, 1992), over the period from 1979 through  to  1990,  the  number  of  learners  of  Japanese  language  in  educational  institutions increased 7.7 times to 981, 407, and the number of institutions teaching the Japanese language increased  3.42  times  to  3917.  Accordingly,  a  variety  of  Japanese  language  textbooks  and learning and teaching materials began to be actively developed in the 1990s.\\n\\nJudging from our analysis, it appears that the first major Japanese language textbook that introduces a product associated with JPC is Japanese for Everyone (Nagara 1990). The textbook uses one whole page to introduce six yon-koma MANGA 2  (four-frame comic strips) taken from Fuji Santar\\u014d created by Sanpei Sat\\u014d under the heading of 'Culture Notes' (Nagara 1990: 289). Although the textbook encourages learners to read the MANGA, the purpose of these comic strips seems to be more for introducing a life and culture surrounding a salary-man rather than teaching the language itself.\\n\\nA  yon-koma  MANGA  mostly  follows  the  Japanese  narrative  structure  (ki-sh\\u014d-tenketsu), aided by the characters' brief wordings in each frame, with a clear story development towards the conclusion with a punch-line in the last frame. Thus, it is not surprising that yonkoma MANGA is perceived as ideal and fun for learning and teaching Japanese. Actually, the idea to use yon-koma MANGA had already been employed in another textbook several years earlier  than Japanese  for  Everyone appeared.    In Shizen  na  Nihongo (Sakurai  1984),  each chapter  begins  with  a  picture  of  only  yon-koma  manga  (with  additional  onomatopoeia  and symbols) created by the author, and characters' utterances including key expressions presented separately, followed by some examples. According to Sakurai (1991), her motivation to publish such  a  textbook  came  from  a  demand  for  developing  learning  and  teaching  materials  for learners at the intermediate level who were eager to learn Japanese conversation. Textbooks that were designed for learners at the intermediate level were few in those days; thus, Sakurai's application of yon-koma manga into language textbook was insightful.  However, it was not an attempt to teach Japanese language by authentic MANGA.\\n\\n\\n## MANGAJIN (1990-97): MOVEMENT FROM OUTSIDE JAPAN\\n\\n\\nTo  our  knowledge, 3 the  first  publication  that  extensively  focuses  on  authentic  'manga' (MANGA) for learning the Japanese language was the periodical, Mangajin , developed by a businessman and translator, Vaughan Simmons, in the late 1980s and published between 1990 and 1997. The magazine was not primarily published as a Japanese language textbook or  a reference,  but  more  for  non-Japanese,  particularly  Americans,  to  learn  about  Japan  to  do business  successfully  with  Japan.  According  to  The  Mangajin  Story  on  web.archive.org, Simmons believed that one would have to have some insights into the Japanese language to really understand Japanese people, but this should be achieved not by whitewashed reference sources made  by Japanese authors for foreign consumption but  through the current popular culture products that the Japanese themselves consume.  Thus, the use of MANGA as a focus of the magazine seemed to have been an ideal solution to fulfil his objectives.\\n\\nAccording  to  Schodt  (1983),  interest  in  Japanese  comics  and  artists  increased  in America in the early 1980s, and American fans of Japanese comics regularly appeared at comic conventions  doing  the  then  equivalent  of  present-day  cosplay.  Bona  fide  American  fans  of Japanese MANGA and anime were fascinated by their artwork, buying raw MANGA/anime from  Japan,  and  relied  on  their  Japanese  friends  to  informally  translate  them  for  more information (Schodt 1983).  Interestingly, Schodt argues that one of the obstacles preventing MANGA  from becoming international was the subject matter in MANGA  being 'incomprehensible  or  uninteresting  to  people  unfamiliar  with  Japanese  ways  or  they  may contain an unacceptable level of violence and eroticism' (Schodt 1983: 154), and he exemplifies this with the subject of 'salary-men'. Considering this, Simmons's attempt to pick up MANGA of this kind can be said to be a challenge, but also an innovation.\\n\\nEach Mangajin issue focused on several titles including yon-koma MANGA and short episodes  of  between  twenty  and  50  frames  taken  from  a  variety  of  genres.  Each  title  was presented in its original format appearing on the left side of the magazine and its exegesis on the right side, with a romanized reading of wordings, narrations and onomatopoeia together with translations and cultural notes in English frame by frame. To fulfil Simmons's objectives, the  magazine  also  introduced  various  cultural  and  societal  trends  of  Japan  at  the  time  via Japanese food, drink, television programmes and other JPC products.\\n\\nAlthough Mangajin was not a language textbook per se, we observe that it was used in the classroom, not necessarily in Japanese language classes either, but also in English-language classes targeting native speakers of Japanese, and even in a JPC course taught at a university in America  (see  Issue  30  1993:  20).  This  seems  to  reflect  a  particular  demography  of  the magazine's readers. According to a survey conducted in 1992 (see Issue 16, p. 6), 87.76% of the total respondents ( n =646) were active learners of the Japanese language, whether learning informally or formally, who valued the language component as equal to the popular culture component (49.92%) or even more on the language component (42.59%). It is assumed that in the early 1990s when there was a paucity of resources, Mangajin was considered a valuable authentic resource for learning Japanese language and culture by North Americans.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Mangajin faced  financial  problems  following  the  Japanese  economic downturn in mid 1990, and discontinued with its 70th issue in 1997. According to Sawasaki (2005),  the  number  of  Japanese  language  learners  at  North  American  tertiary  institutions decreased from its peak in 1992 towards 1998 due to the weakened Japanese economy and educational budget cuts. Since the Japanese language learning boom of the mid- to the late1980s  was  triggered  by Japan's  strong  economy,  attracting learners for business  and\\n\\nemployment opportunities (The Japan Foundation 2003, cited in Sawasaki 2005), this loss of interest  in  learning  Japanese  is  understandable.  Thus,  it  seems  that  the  financial  problems Mangajin encountered were not simply influenced by the downturn of the Japanese economy, but were also affected by its readers losing interest in learning Japanese and about Japan.\\n\\n\\n## NIHONGO KY\\u014cIKU TS\\u016aSHIN AND GEKKAN NIHONGO : ADVOCACY\\n\\n\\nWhile learning and teaching Japanese via JPC was initiated by non-Japanese represented by the example of Mangajin , educators and organizations in Japan who controlled Japanese language education also began to publicly recognize this New Wave of learning and teaching of Japanese. We can trace this recognition by drawing upon two major periodicals, Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin and Gekkan Nihongo ,  which were well distributed to educators and researchers in Japanese language teaching in the 1990s. 4\\n\\nNihongo  Ky\\u014diku  Ts\\u016bshin was  a  trimonthly  newsletter;  JF  has  been  publishing  for overseas Japanese  language  instructors since 1990. Its purpose is to offer readers the  latest information on Japanese learning and teaching, particularly Japanese language materials, tips for classroom teaching, issues surrounding Japanese culture and society and general information  on  Japanese  language  education.  On  the  other  hand, Gekkan  Nihongo was published by a major private publisher of language education, ALC Press. Originally engaged with English-language education since its establishment in 1969, ALC extended its business to Japanese-language  education  in  1986  with  the  publication  of  the  monthly  magazine The Nihongo  Journal targeting  foreign  learners  of  the  Japanese  language,  followed    by    the publication of Gekkan Nihongo in  1987. The target readers of Gekkan Nihongo were mostly Japanese residing in Japan who were engaged in Japanese-language education and those who intend to become Japanese-language instructors, in contrast to Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin, which especially targeted overseas Japanese-language instructors.\\n\\nLooking back at the time when these periodicals were being published, the demand for Japanese  language  education  was  on  the  rise,  but  accessibility  to  innovative  learning  and teaching  resources  was  limited,  except  for  the  small  number  of  commercially  available textbooks  and  references  in  overseas  countries.  Unlike  today,  when  educators  can  access whatever we need immediately by merely going online, instructors and researchers at that time had to solely rely on hardcopy information for their communication and resources; hence, it was costly in terms of money and time. The network for instructors and researchers outside Japan was not well developed either until the advent and spread of the Internet in the late 1990s. 5 Thus, Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin was a significant resource.\\n\\nOf the two periodicals, Gekkan Nihongo was the first to publish a special issue that dealt with using MANGA in classroom. The June 1993 issue devotes nineteen pages on the topic, consisting of interviews with academics who were using manga in their tertiary and vocational language classes, and tips for using yon-koma MANGA, story MANGA 6  and other MANGArelated learning and teaching activities. The titles of MANGA that are focused  in that issue include Sazae-san ,  a  yon-koma  MANGA about family  life surrounding a house-wife called Sazae (by Machiko Hasegawa), Hi no Tori/ Phoenix, a long science-fiction story MANGA (by Osamu  Tezuka), Peesuke ,  a  yon-koma  MANGA  about  a  life  of  a  salary-man  (by  Shunji Sonoyama), OL  Shinkaron ,  a  yon-koma  MANGA  about  daily  life  faced  by  female  office workers (by Risu Akizuki), and Kach\\u014d Shima K\\u014dsaku , a story MANGA about a salary-man (by Kenshi  Hirokane).  The  issue  boldly  advocates  the  usefulness  and  effectiveness  of  using MANGA in the Japanese-language class by arguing:\\n\\n- \\uf0b7 Japan  is  a  nation  of  'manga  power'  ('manga'  taikoku)  that  has  been  generating countless number of high-quality titles\\n- \\uf0b7 'manga'  provide  the  reader  with  a  rich  knowledge  of  authentic  conversations  that language textbooks do not cover\\n- \\uf0b7 'manga'  also  reflect  the  culture  and  society  of  Japan,  and  is  hence  an  excellent reference for the learners; and\\n- \\uf0b7 'manga' are cheaper than textbooks or videos, and easy to obtain.\\n\\nOn  page  nineteen  of  this  special  issue  covering  MANGA  in  the  Japanese  language  class, Mangajin is  introduced as a recommended reference; thus, we can observe that the trend of using  'manga'  in  those  days  was  being  inspired  by  non-Japanese  learners  and  teachers  of Japanese.\\n\\nIn comparison to Gekkan Nihongo , Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin seemed to have been more cautious of using JPC products in the classroom. The first time the newsletter mentioned any JPC product was in the 1993 May issue (Volume 15), which was almost the same time as the special  issue  of Gekkan  Nihongo was  published.  The  article  appears  in  the  Q&amp;A  network section, where a language professional at JF answers a question by a language instructor from Thailand about teaching Japanese language using authentic materials. The language professional suggested a newspaper with some examples including Fuji Santar\\u014d , a yon-koma MANGA. However, after that, there was no mention of JPC until JF began to pay more attention\\n\\nto JPC in language education in 1994. In fact, Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin mentions JPC in three consecutive issues from the February 1994 issue (Volume 18).\\n\\nFirst, the popular anime title Tonari no Totoro/My Neighbor Totoro (Miyazaki, 1988) was  indirectly  mentioned as a  newly developed  learning software  in  a  special  article  about Computer Assisted Instruction and Japanese-language education (Kato 1994). Then, references to JPC in the newsletter became more focused issue by issue. The May 1994 issue (Volume 19) introduces Mangajin as a reference to understand 'up-to-date information about Japan', a part of  the  regular  four-page  article  series, Nihongo  Ky\\u014dzai  Sh\\u014dkai /Introduction  to  Japaneselanguage teaching materials (Hirose et al. 1994), and finally the August 1994 issue (Volume 20) directly linked JPC to language teaching in the same article series. The article picks up the above-mentioned OL shinkaron , Oishinbo , a story MANGA about food and the adventures of a culinary journalist, Shir\\u014d Yamaoka (by Tetsu Kariya and artwork by Akira Hanasaki), and My Neighbor Totoro , and introduces them in relation to learning and teaching of language and culture, together with several other 'manga' and anime titles.\\n\\nThe titles of JPC Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin informs in these volumes are similar to what Gekkan Nihongo introduces. However, unlike Gekkan Nihongo , which referred to Japan as the nation power of 'manga'/'manga' taikoku', and eagerly suggested instructors of the Japanese language to use 'manga' in their classrooms, Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin introduces the use of 'manga' and anime in class in a rather modest way. For example, the following extract is part of the foreword appearing in a 1994 article:\\n\\n'Manga'/animation are important cultures of Japan, and there are more than a few titles of high quality that contribute to a profound effect (on learning Japanese language) if they are utilized in class (Anon.1994: 10).\\n\\nWhile Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin also values 'manga' and anime as important Japanese cultural properties, it is clearly stated that there are titles of high quality that can be utilized in class for profound effect. This may be due to its target readers, Japanese-language instructors residing overseas, where accessibility to JPC products was limited at the time of the publication of these issues. Even so, it is possible to make the claim that the newsletter implied that not all JPC products  are  suitable  for  language  teaching.  It  is  unknown  how  JF  defined  'high  quality'; however, given that the newsletter selects titles that reflect ordinary people's daily life to more serious cultural and social issues in Japan such as working life, gender, housing and the law, the dichotomy that the newsletter seems to have created is a clear one: these types of titles are\\n\\nthe more suitable ones, while titles based on the imagination such as sci-fi, horror or adventure are not.\\n\\nThis stance may also be shared with Gekkan Nihongo in its June 1993 issue for focusing on titles  similar to those  mentioned  in Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin .  Although Osamu Tezuka's W3/The Amazing 3 and Hi no Tori were referred to, these titles appear only in an interview with an  instructor  of  a  French-Japanese  translation  class,  and  the  majority  of  the  nineteen-page special article focused on 'manga' that are family oriented (e.g. Sazae-san ) or business oriented (e.g. OL Shinkaron , Kach\\u014d Shima K\\u014dsaku ).\\n\\nOkuhara et al. (1993: 14) claim that the reason for selecting these titles includes their accessibility, usability as teaching materials, popularity and entertaining story lines.  However, they fail to explain the reason for choosing these titles over countless other popular 'manga' titles that seem to fulfil the criteria mentioned directly above. Thus, Gekkan Nihongo also seems to have divided 'manga' titles into those that can be used in class from those that cannot be used.\\n\\nThe question is what the demand arising from the learners' side was. Were these titles the  ones  that  learners  wanted  to  read or  learn  from?    It  is  not  possible  to  present  any  firm answers to these questions, but there are interesting data that might answer them. The 1992 Mangajin survey  results  mentioned  above  provide  insights  into  the  genres  of  'manga'  that readers would like to see in future issues of Mangajin . Contemporary fiction came in at first place (49.69% of respondents), followed by historical fiction (44.89%), science fiction (37%) and business related (29.88%). Considering Mangajin continually published business-related 'manga', this positioning could be interpreted as that the readers were already satisfied with those amounts, although it is interesting that the percentage of readers who voted for science fiction was far more than those who voted for the business related genre. Looking back at those days  in  North  America,  since  the  successful  release  of  the  anime Akira (\\u014ctomo,  1988)  in December 1989, it is not surprising that there was a demand for science fiction from the readers.\\n\\nOn the other hand, judging from the following (Okuhara et al. 1993), we can assume that the  suggestion  of  using  'manga'  originated  more  from  the  instructors'  side  for  the  sake  of variation  and  enrichment  of  teaching  materials  rather  than  any  demand  from  the  learners themselves.\\n\\nTo Instructors of  Japanese  language  who  have  been  trying  various  measures  to make teaching materials, for us being in the Nation of 'manga' Power, it would be a huge waste not to utilise 'manga' as teaching materials. If we use them effectively, our classroom activities should become far livelier from tomorrow. (Okuhara et al. 1993: 14)\\n\\nAs research into Japanese language education and JPC was not well developed in the early 1990s, there is no evidence that the learners did not enjoy learning Japanese with these titles, but the encouragement of using 'manga' in those days did not seem to be based on any close analysis of learners' motivations.\\n\\nInterestingly, neither Gekkan Nihongo nor Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin published any other focused articles about 'manga' and anime since then. Looking back at the mid-1990s, following the initial advancement in technology, the focus on learning and teaching materials gradually shifted from a hardcopy to softcopy using computers and the Internet . In particular, the Internet 7 catered for both learners and teachers of the Japanese language as a great potential for accessing various  sorts  of  learning  and  teaching  materials  instantly  online,  although  it  was  yet  to  be developed and distributed at that time. Accordingly, the struggle of Japanese language teachers to find proper teaching materials (hardcopies) as mentioned in Okuhara et al. (1993) became less.  Thus, although 'manga' and anime may still have been used in Japanese language classes at the grass-roots level, they became one of the many resources from where instructors could choose in the mid-1990s onwards; hence, this particular topic of using JPC in language learning was buried under the broader discussion of Japanese language education.\\n\\n\\n## RESEARCH  INTO  JPC  IN  JAPANESE-LANGUAGE  EDUCATION:  STUDIES  OF MANGA AND ANIME\\n\\n\\nThis second part discusses research into JPC in Japanese language education over a period of about 25 years since the mid-1980s. Considering the various societal movements, these 25 years are roughly divided into three periods: (1) Beginnings to silent period (mid 1980s-1990s); (2) Cool  Japan  initiative  period  (early  2000s);  and  (3)  Official  promotion  of  JPC  in  Japanese language education period (post 2006). Research in each period is discussed.\\n\\n\\n## Beginnings to silent period: From the mid-1980s to the 1990s\\n\\n\\nAccording to the available data, the first research into JPC in Japanese language education was Kanamori (1989), who analysed vocabulary  in MANGA for classroom teaching. Following Kanamori, Okazaki (1993) introduced teaching methodologies using yon-koma MANGA, story MANGA focusing on social topics and hito-koma (one frame) MANGA. Arai and Akahori (1998) discussed the systematic development of Japanese learning using yon-koma MANGA. The common idea of all this research was that 'manga' is recognized as a very efficient tool to teach language in context.\\n\\nHowever, despite the various ideas and practices discussed in Part 1, there was little research into JPC in Japanese language education in the 1990s. There are a few reasons for this. First,  research  into  classroom  activities  (e.g.  action  research)  was  not  actively  attempted. Second, MANGA was placed in a vulnerable position in Japanese society in the early 1990s, following a nationwide movement to banish harmful MANGA originating from housewives' concerns of the negative effects of 'manga' on children, which then spread to the education sector,  feminists  and  politicians  (Galbraith  2015).  Okazaki  criticizes  this  movement,  and encourages Japanese-language instructors to abandon their prejudice against using MANGA in the  classroom (1993). From Okazaki, and what  is discussed  in Part 1,  we can observe two contrasting views on 'manga' in the Japanese language classroom: (1) to promote MANGA as learning and teaching resources, and (2) against such promotion. Third, the significant impact of  Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL)  in the  mid-1990s seemed to have swept away  the  idea  of  using  JPC  in  the  classroom.  Accordingly,  research  into  the  field  became invisible from the mid-1990s towards the end of the twentieth century. We refer to this time as 'the silent period', although it is interesting to note that some JPC titles that contributed to the JPC  boom  in  the  2000s,  such  as  Pok\\u00e9mon,  Digimon  and  Sailor  Moon,  became  popular worldwide during this period.\\n\\n\\n## Cool Japan initiative period: The early 2000s\\n\\n\\nThe early 2000s is the period when JPC became the centre of the world's attention. Following this trend, the Nihon 'manga' gakkai (The Society of Japanese 'manga') was established in 2001. Also, a significant number of studies on anime/'manga' in Japanese-language education began  to  be  produced.  The  first  study  is 'manga'  gaku  no  susume (Encouragement  of Researching  into 'manga') by Kusaka (2000), who gave lectures for Manga research at her university. In her first paper about MANGA and Japanese language education, Chinami (2002), another noteworthy scholar of this field, argues that the selection of MANGA requires clear aims and learning activities to develop the learners' language ability.\\n\\nSince 2002, Chinami has contributed to the study of MANGA in Japanese language education through her various studies. For example, she attempted to introduce the pragmatics of  Japanese  communication  using  MANGA  to  foreign  learners  of  the  Japanese  language (Chinami 2004, 2005, 2008). Another focus of Chinami's research into MANGA in Japaneselanguage education is linguistic presentation of gender and politeness (2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008). Her various attempts became a solid foundation for the current studies of MANGA in Japanese-language education.\\n\\n\\n## Official promotion of jpc period: Post 2006\\n\\n\\nAs mentioned above, 2006 was a notable year when JPC and Japanese-language education were officially recognized by public sectors of Japanese-language education in Japan. It was as recent as  2007  when  JF  cooperated  with  several  associations  such  as  Nihongo  Ky\\u014diku  Gakkai  to organize forums and workshops to promote ways to make better use of 'manga' and anime for learning and teaching the Japanese language (Kumano and Kawashima 2011). The increasing number of studies into this field in 2007 and 2008 (e.g. Hagino 2007; Hattori 2008; Hong\\u014d 2007;  Kumano  and  Hirokaga  2008;  Watanabe  and  Fuse  2008)  proves  researchers'  serious consideration of MANGA as a research topic. Post 2006 research into the field includes various topics such as classroom activities and learner's motivation (e.g. Imura and Northwood in this issue).  These  studies  can  be  categorized  into  three  groups  according  to  their  focused perspectives: (1) teachers' perspectives, (2) learners' perspectives and (3) linguistic perspectives.\\n\\nFirst, the research from the teachers' perspectives was pioneered by Chinami, followed by a number of case studies out of researchers' classroom teaching using MANGA (e.g. Hagino 2007; Hong\\u014d 2007; Kihara 2010). Given that the various ideas of using JPC in classrooms had already been discussed in the early 1990s, the emergence of publications on this topic seems to be  quite  late.  However,  these  studies  seem  to  reflect  the  increasing  number  of  learners motivated by JPC  in post 2000; hence, they are dynamic  in dealing with both learning and teaching, rather than discussions in early days that focus only on teaching.\\n\\nSecond, studies of JPC in Japanese language education from the learners' perspectives became active post 2006. For example, Ishikura (2013), Kumano and Hirokaga (2008), and Northwood  and  Thomson  (2012)  investigated  the  learners'  motivations  to  study  Japanese linked to JPC. In the classroom setting, Watanabe and Fuse (2008) revealed students' negative reactions  and  a  perceived  gap  between  the  Japanese  language  in  the  'real'  world  and  what appears in MANGA and anime. In contrast, Fukunaga (2006) discusses how anime influences learners' literacy development, and argues that repetitive watching of anime provides multiple advantages including word recognition, listening and pronunciation for learning Japanese.\\n\\nKumano and Kawashima (2011) broke fresh ground for ways of using anime/'manga' as a teaching medium.  Their needs survey became a foundation to develop an online learning site as a part of JF's project (Kumano 2010; Kumano and Kawashima 2011). The survey result suggests that anime/MANGA fans wish to learn specific vocabulary and grammar that appear in  anime/MANGA  but  are  rarely  used  in  the  'real'  world.  Following  this,  Kumano  and Kawashima (2011) developed an e-learning tool named anime/'manga' no Nihongo (Japanese\\n\\nlanguage for anime and 'manga'), which enables learners to become familiar with the unique vocabulary  and  expressions  in  both  media.  Over  1.55  million  accesses  from  168  countries within eight months since its release in February 2010 (Kumano and Kawashima 2011) indicate the users' high interest in this learning tool.\\n\\nResearch  into  anime/MANGA  in  Japanese-language  education  focusing  on  their linguistic analysis includes the studies of vocabulary (Kumano 2011; Unser-Schutz 2011, 2013), onomatopoeia  (Hattori  2008),  gender  (Chinami  2003),  pragmatics  (Chinami  2005),  role language (Kinsui 2007; Teshigawara and Kinsui 2011) and discourse (Hongo 2007; Naruoka 2012). Unser-Schutz (2011) is particularly notable for presenting a new perspective of MANGA as a linguistic learning and teaching resource by her corpora of eight popular MANGA titles including 'One Piece' (by Eiji Oda). Her study (Unser-Schutz 2013: 93) revealed that the level of language use differs across MANGA genres, i.e. sh\\u014dnen (boys) MANGA is more difficult than sh\\u014djo (girls) MANGA.\\n\\nAs  in  Chinami (2002),  the  selection  of  suitable  MANGA  for  language  learning  and teaching  is  difficult  but  important  for  the  teacher.  In  this  sense,  Unser-Schutz's  attempts contribute towards the future of learning and teaching Japanese language with JPC. A database of anime/MANGA, where the titles can be sorted by the level of difficulty with their vocabulary, expressions and grammar, would be ideal. In doing so, JPC fans can learn Japanese by only focusing on what they want to know. Furthermore, such a database would contribute towards promoting the user's motivation further to learn Japanese language  linked to their interest in JPC.\\n\\nThe literature review in this part reveals that research into JPC (or more precisely into MANGA/anime in Japanese-language education) became more intense since 2006. The use of JPC represented by MANGA and anime seems to have yielded new insights and innovations into the learning and teaching of Japanese language as a foreign language by the learners and potential learners (fans of JPC) themselves in recent years, which has led to increased learnerfocused studies of JPC in Japanese-language education.\\n\\n\\n## A TENTATIVE CONCLUSION\\n\\n\\nIt  has  been  over  a  quarter  of  a  century  since  JPC  became  influential  in  Japanese-language education.  During  this  period,  this  influence  has  changed  from  peripheral,  which  merely supplemented the  insufficient amount or  a variety of  learning and teaching  materials, or to understand Japanese culture of the time rather than language itself, to one of the core learning and  teaching  resources  and  linked  directly  to  research.  Furthermore,  recent  research  also\\n\\nsuggests  that  the  influence  of  JPC  in  informal  learning  settings  needs  to  be  accounted  for. Although the informal mode of learning has yet to be studied in detail to make any significant conclusions,  some  existing  studies  argue  that  a  significant  number  of  Japanese  language learners  in  the  formal  mode of  learning (e.g. university or school) are initially  motivated to enrol  into  Japanese-language  courses  due  to  their  interest  in  JPC  (Japan  Foundation  2011; Northwood and Thomson 2012).\\n\\nWhat  we  can  see  is  a  strong  link  between  Japanese-language  learning  and  JPC  in contemporary  Japanese-language  education.  However,  considering  the  nature  of  popular culture - one that reflects the society of a particular period of time, hence it changes from time to time following the trends of culture, economics, politics and technology - the current position of Japanese-language education that significantly relies on JPC is vulnerable. In fact, despite the government's promotion of JPC under the broad umbrella known as the Cool Japan Policy, we believe that worldwide interest in JPC may have already passed its peak since  the early 2000s according to Google Trends.  Similarly, JF's latest survey result  (The Japan Foundation 8 2017) indicates the declining number of learners of the Japanese language around the world compared with the number in 2012, which is the first time numbers have declined since 1979, when  the  survey  began.  Enrolment  in  Japanese-language  courses  at  tertiary  institutions  in Australia  has  decreased  as  well.    While  the  reasons  for  the  decreasing  enrolment  may  be attributed to multiple factors including the university system and consuming JPC outside the classroom (Northwood and Thomson 2012),  as far as current learners'  motivation to learn Japanese is mainly triggered by interest in JPC, it is uncertain how long this trend will last. When the world loses interest in JPC and the Japanese government abandons the Cool Japan Policy, we may face a significant decrease in the  numbers of enrolment in Japanese Studies at tertiary institutions, and ultimately closure of Japanese Studies departments.\\n\\nThe good news is that Google Trends still shows a moderate and stable public interest in anime and 'manga'. In fact, JPC conventions around the world still attract large numbers of participants. Thus, there are still many fans of JPC, whose population is believed to be much larger  than  Japanese-language  learners,  and  there  is  a  great  potential  for  them  to  become learners of Japanese in formal education (Armour and Iida 2016; Kond\\u014d and Muranaka 2010).\\n\\nWhat is  yet to  be  clear  is  how these  fans  of  JPC  learn  or  do  not  learn  the  Japanese language. Following technological advancement, accessing learning resources is not as difficult as it was in the 1990s. Thus, learners or potential learners of Japanese have more options for learning. Japanese-language education in formal institutions should continue to pay attention to JPC in Japanese-language education.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 490,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This study examined whether disclosing a study\\u2019s preprint status in a news report affects audience perceptions and behavioural intensions.

Drawing upon previous studies, I examine how the seemingly fair meritocratic selection in the transition from upper-secondary to higher education in Japan, where only one in five undergraduate students in the nation\\u2019s top university are women, contributes to the persistence of women\\u2019s \\u201cleaky pipeline\\u201d to selective colleges. The results from longitudinal surveys of high schoolers and their parents reveal that parents\\u2019 educational expectations and psychological traits relevant to competitive environments are not associated with the gender gap in exam-retaking. Instead, the positive association between aspirations to attend a selective college and exam-retaking is significantly reduced for women, suggesting that men and women with similar competitive academic aspirations are treated differently. These results provide important evidence to reduce gender inequality in science, politics, and the labor market.\",\n          \"This article discusses a history of Japanese popular culture (JPC) located in the broader field of Japanese language education, particularly focusing on \\u2018manga\\u2019. JPC has drawn the public attention of Japanese language educators following an international boom in the consumption of anime and \\u2018manga\\u2019 in the early 2000s. However, looking into JPC and its location in the context of Japanese language education, its history goes further back to the late 1980s and the early 1990s, when \\u2018manga\\u2019 and anime began to be used in classrooms. Despite active attempts using JPC in Japanese language education, research into this field was still inactive until the end of the twentieth century.  This article is therefore aimed at connecting classroom practices and research into JPC over time since the late 1980s to look into how JPC in Japanese language education has been viewed and used differently in its trajectory and implies its future direction. The article first critically discusses the early days of JPC, namely \\u2018manga\\u2019 in Japanese language education by reviewing three periodicals of the early to the mid-1990s \\u2013 Mangajin, Gekkan Nihongo and  Nihongo Ky\\u014diku Ts\\u016bshin. Second, the article overviews research into \\u2018manga\\u2019/anime and Japanese language education from the late 1980s to early 2010. The results of the analyses imply that the early days of JPC in Japanese language education were triggered by the struggle of the instructors finding teaching resources rather than the motivation of the learners. In contrast, a number of more recent studies of JPC in Japanese language education align with both the learners\\u2019 and the teachers\\u2019 demands and motivations of daily classroom practice.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_len\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 20641,\n        \"min\": 10218,\n        \"max\": 196911,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 487,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34833,\n          42062,\n          19250\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary_len\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 428,\n        \"min\": 187,\n        \"max\": 4359,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 409,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1048,\n          1405,\n          2108\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_len_log\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2081491813986349,\n        \"min\": 4.009365898346244,\n        \"max\": 5.294269977721985,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 487,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.541990879779469,\n          4.623889919047242,\n          4.28443073384452\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary_len_log\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.15718957724602245,\n        \"min\": 2.271841606536499,\n        \"max\": 3.639386869017684,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 409,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3.0203612826477078,\n          3.1476763242410986,\n          3.323870606540509\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"my_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 490,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This study investigated how disclosing a COVID-19 preprint status in a news report influences public perceptions, trust, and behavioral intentions, with a focus on whether the level of disclosure (brief versus expanded) and audience political orientation moderate these effects.

The research assesses potential explanations for this gender gap, including variations in aspirations, parental expectations, and psychological attitudes toward competition, while controlling for compositional differences. The findings highlight that gendered responses to exam failure and retaking risks may perpetuate existing inequalities, with implications for educational reforms that emphasize standardized testing as a means of meritocratic advancement.

His discovery of Miyazaki and Takahata through interviews and interactions with high school girls led him to appreciate the artistic and thematic depth of their work, notably inspiring him after viewing Horus: Prince of the Sun. Suzuki played a pivotal role in promoting Miyazakiâ€™s early works, including the serialization of NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of the Wind in Animage, which significantly boosted its popularity and led to the film adaptation produced by Tokuma Shoten. His efforts in identifying talent and fostering relationships with Miyazaki and Takahata were instrumental in establishing the foundation for Studio Ghibli and its subsequent global influence.\",\n",

Methodologically, it examines specific translated extracts and critically assesses the influence of the self-translator's intent and the co-translator's literalist stance, revealing tensions between cultural fidelity and target language appropriateness. Findings suggest that the collaborative process, with dominant co-translation and conflicting translator perspectives, resulted in partial preservation of original features, with some cultural nuances diluted or altered. The effectiveness of literal versus functional translation approaches is discussed, highlighting the compromises made in rendering culturally embedded expressions within the constraints of collaborative translation. Overall, the study demonstrates that the interplay between translators significantly shapes the linguistic and cultural integrity of the target text.\",\n",
              " 170: 'This study emphasizes the growing global prevalence and persistent stigmatization of ADHD, highlighting how societal misconceptions portray individuals with the disorder as inferior, which hampers treatment-seeking and exacerbates psychological distress. The research methods involve analyzing existing literature on the social manifestation of ADHD stigma, its long-term impact on mental health, academic performance, and employment, with a specific focus on cultural perceptions in Taiwanâ€”a region where such social attitudes remain underexplored. Findings reveal that stigmatization leads to negative labeling from childhood, discourages individuals from seeking medical help, and results in adverse outcomes such as lower life satisfaction and reduced employment opportunities, especially in adulthood. The COVID-19 pandemic has further amplified these issues by increasing ADHD symptoms and treatment needs globally, underscoring the urgent necessity for targeted intervention and increased awareness to combat harmful social perceptions and improve quality of life for those affected.',\n",

By contrasting the distribution of research investments (de facto priorities) with societal demands, the research assesses the extent of mismatch, particularly in upstream (preventive and systemic) versus downstream (clinical and immediate) health research. The findings reveal significant gaps between current research focus and stakeholder-perceived needs, highlighting the challenges in shifting research priorities within institutional and policy frameworks. The study advocates for broader institutional reforms and methodological tools to foster reflexive monitoring, aiming to better align research efforts with societal health demands and support transformative policy change.',\n",
              " 347: \"This study investigates the writing challenges faced by ESL students in an Intensive English Program and examines the impact of instructional scaffolding on their writing performance from their perspectives. Using a qualitative approach grounded in social constructivism and Vygotsky's concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, the research highlights prevalent difficulties such as issues with sentence structure, cohesion, and L1 interference. It emphasizes that scaffoldingâ€”dynamic, purposeful, and responsive supportâ€”can enhance writing quality by fostering interaction, feedback, and gradual independence. The findings suggest that tailored scaffolding improves fluency, accuracy, and studentsâ€™ awareness of writing processes, aligning with theories that knowledge is constructed through social interaction and guided assistance.\"}"

This  trend  is  supported  using  subsets  defined  by  the  quantity  of  waste  managed. Multiple factors aid in explaining this result, and among others, due to scale and scope, factors such as transition costs increase with the number of players running different services.\\n\\n\\n## Practical implications\\n\\n\\nThe provision of public services of economic interest should favour the participation of more companies wherever possible to the extent that social surplus is produced. However, pursuing this principle to the detriment of efficient service  delivery  is  not  ideal.  This  paper  demonstrated  that  a  single-provider  waste  management  business  model  is efficient under specific conditions, as in this article.\\n\\n\\n## Originality\\n\\n\\nThis  paper  presents  an  original  research  methodology  for  comparatively  analysing  waste  management  service efficiency in urban areas and provides adequate evidence using alternative measures of costs according to the phase of the waste management chain, the scale, and ultimately the scope of municipal solid waste management services.\\n\\n\\n## 1. Introduction\\n\\n\\nPublic services of general economic  interest are fundamental  to the nation's economic development and significantly impact social welfare (Boggio, 2016). The operational efficiency of the  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  management  industry  has  become  increasingly  significant  for achieving sustainable development objectives (Zorpas, 2020). Business and governance models of MSW management need to evolve towards efficiency levels compatible with the achievement of economic and environmental objectives (Kaza et al. , 2018). Research has exposed the critical need for  assessing  different  models  of  governance  and  organisation,  and  entrusting  services  for  the governance  and  delivery  of  public  services  (Soukopov\\u00e1 et  al. , 2017).  Trade-offs  between  the competitive dimensions in industrial structures characterised by imperfect competition must also be considered.\\n\\nTypically,  local  authorities  can  choose  between  three  models  and  procedures:  entrusting  the service  to  third  parties  through  public  procedures,  the  provision  of  the  services  through  hybrid public-private  firms  and  in-house  provision.  Free  market  and  competition  rules  apply  to  actors entrusted  with  providing  public  services  for  economic  interests  as  long  as  these  rules  do  not prevent them from fulfilling their general mission (European Commission, 2022).\\n\\nAdditionally, the principle that underpins European competition and public procurement legislation  since  the  introduction  of  Directive  2014/24/EU  is  important,  which  is  to  encourage small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to participate in public procurement and, thereby, in the  provision  of  public  services.  However,  this  principle  can  be  abandoned  by  considering integrated utilities, which can provide more services at various stages of the chain, owing to the economies  of  scale  and  scope  resulting  from  their  production  efficiency.  Subdividing  large municipalities  can  be  assumed  to  lead  to  greater  competition,  fostering  growth  among  service providers  (Sarra et  al. ,  2020).  However,  on  the  contrary,  a  recent  empirical  study  focused  on Barcelona revealed that multiple firms can strategically interact to maximise producer surplus at the expense of social welfare (Be l and Seb\\u0151, 2021).\\n\\nMSW management can be regarded as  an  industry  with  two  or  more  intertwined  phases.  The market structure in the first phase is mainly labour-intensive, while the second phase is capitalintensive and supported by enabling infrastructure, such as waste treatment plants. Both phases are subject to the risk of market failure, and in certain circumstances, the market can effectively manage one or more services (Di Foggia and Beccarello, 2018).\\n\\nThe industrial  organisation  of the  collection phase  often  involves  local monopoly  configurations justified  by  the  economies  of  scale  resulting  from  the  size  of  the  service  and  its  economies  of scope  (AGCM,  2016).  Much  has  been  written  regarding  the  existence  of  scale  economies,  an important  issue  with  some  consensus  (Callan  and  Thomas,  2001),  as  confirmed  in  previous analyses  that  also  found  scale  economies  and  some  efficiency  differences  between  public  and private providers (Tickner and Mcdavid, 1986). Early research in the field of economies of scale focused on the interrelationships of scale, market structure, and costs, with scattered evidence in\\n\\nthe beginning, based on the little evidence of the existence of certain scale economies (Stevens, 1978).\\n\\nIn this regard, the more recent findings on economies of scale have provided mixed results. For example,  a  recent  study  found  that  less  than  half  (40.4%  of  the  municipalities  evaluated), presented  negative  economies  of  scale  (Llanquileo-Melgarejo  and  Molinos-Senante,  2021). Another study underscores the drivers of costs under alternative cost definitions (Di Foggia and Beccarello,  2020).  Similarly,  a  third  article  concluded  that  population  and  size  are  important factors for scale economies, and the implication is uncertain (Wowrzeczka, 2021). This uncertainty is  partly  due  to  information  asymmetries  that  complicate  comparative  analyses.  Another  factor that concurs with mixed results is the unit of analysis.\\n\\nIndeed, many studies aimed at understanding the economies of scope in MSW management by focusing on the input factors of firms and very different output variables, failing to differentiate among collection costs, total costs, and treatment costs or using per capita cost against costs per unit of waste.\\n\\nScale  economies  in  a  public  service  of  general  interest  such  as  waste  management  should  be evaluated from the perspective of the contracting authority, paying more attention to exogenous factors affecting the organisation of the service that must be used at the same level as the input factors of firms. Indeed, failing to consider the above may result in formally correct results but be biased  in  practice  if  the  subadditivity  of  costs  is  not  considered.  Consequently,  the  contracting authorities  may  decide  it  inappropriate  to  divide  the  contract  into  lots  to  avoid  the  risk  of rendering the execution of the contract excessively technically difficult or expensive and because coordinating the different contractors for the lots could risk undermining the proper execution of the contract.\\n\\nSome scholars have empirically evaluated the impact of different regulated business models on MSW management and suggested that their efficiency can  be  increased  by  limiting  the  size  of these service areas so that the system encourages large service providers to compete for service allocation  in  a  large  number  of  small  areas,  thus  intensifying  the  positive  effects  of  market competition (Sarra et al. ,  2020). However, it could be argued that reducing the size of the areas that can be allocated to a single firm may promote anti-competitive strategies aimed at creating divisions between several theoretically competing operators.\\n\\nStrengthening market competition and realising economies of scale by integrating organisations (and  thus  reducing  the  number  of  individual  economic  actors)  can  be  considered  appropriate choices for achieving economic and environmental efficiency. First, this idea is supported based on an econometric model that identifies the main determinants of service costs. Then, the focus was on the analysis of multiple case studies, using a sample consisting of the ten most populous Italian\\n\\ncities. Third, a single case comparing a 'business -asusual' model involving a single economic actor with an alternative scenario consisting of four firms was analysed.\\n\\nEvidence suggests that as the size of the service increases, the average cost tends to decrease. The case  study  confirms  the  presence  of  economies  of  scale,  resulting  from  the  specific  factors employed in the production of the service.\\n\\nThe rest of the article is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review and reports on the previously published studies that have explained some of the aspects analysed in this article. Section 3 describes the context and research design as well as the data collection process and the variables in this study. Section 4 presents the results of the econometric analysis and case studies. Section 5 discusses the main considerations and implications arising from  the findings. The final section concludes.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Background and literature\\n\\n\\nThe complexity of the WM industry raises concerns about the technologies it relies upon and the sustainability of its business models (Bj\\u00f6rklund et al. , 1999), which also depend on how contracts between MSW management providers and institutions are structured (Walls, 2005). In light of the challenging  environmental  goals,  the  efficiency  of  MSW  management  business  models  has become an increasingly important concern (Kinnaman, 2009); thus, their sustainability as well as their  emergent  role  in  local  communities  is  critical  (Avil\\u00e9s-Palacios  and  Rodr\\u00edguez-Olalla,  2021; Esmaeilian et  al. ,  2018).  As  such,  the  relationship  between  efficiency  and  economies of  scale  is attracting  more  attention  at  both  the  political  and  the  organisational  levels.  Accordingly,  the number of studies on the cost of MSW management has grown, such as the analysis of the cost functions (Bohm et al. , 2010) or the cost of recycling environmental policies (Da Cruz et al. , 2014).\\n\\nPrevious literature has focused on the determinants of demand for MSW management services (Diaz-Farina et  al. ,  2020),  organisational  forms  and  modes  of  supply  (Zhang et  al. ,  2015),  policy implications (Goddard, 1995), cost structures (Callan and Thomas, 2001; P\\u00e9rez-L\\u00f3pez et al. , 2016), and the need to develop strategies to achieve sustainability goals. Regarding sustainability goals, geopolitical contingencies  make  it  difficult  to reach  the  binding  agreements  and  credible commitments made by policymakers (Darus et al. , 2020).\\n\\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to analyse the economic efficiency of MSW collection firms.  For  example,  a  recent  study  identified  a  relation  between  costs  and  environmental efficiency, although this relationship is nonlinear, as a rise in the separated waste collection rate increases total costs by a less-than-proportional amount, which provides evidence of the existence of economies of scale (Bartolacci et al. , 2019).\\n\\nEconomic  and  technical  efficiency  have  emerged  as  prominent  factors  in  explaining  costs  (lo Storto,  2021).  Given  the  increasing  pressure  governments  face  to  increase  cost  efficiency,  they\\n\\nmay transfer waste disposal services to private firms  (Jacobsen et  al. ,  2013). This  possibility has raised the dilemma of whether for-profit enterprises are compatible with outcomes that maximise social welfare (Kinnaman, 2009); the available findings are mixed (Bel and Fageda, 2010; Sim\\u00f5es et al. , 2012).\\n\\nEmpirical evidence based on the existing MSW management business models is important, as it shows how economic and political factors exert different impacts on MSW management via both private  and  public  firms  (Plata-D\\u00edaz et  al. , 2014).  Other  studies  indicate  that  private  MSW management operators are not necessarily better performers than public firms (Bel and Fageda, 2010).\\n\\nAdditionally,  firm  size,  inter-firm  relations,  and  alternative  technologies,  as  found  in  studies  on green  reverse  logistics  technology  (Mugoni  et  al.,  2023),  can  be  argued  to  significantly  impact MSW management strategies (Lombrano, 2009). Considering that the size of firms that perform public services may correspond to a greater propensity to innovate, it is intuitive that advancing MSW business models can improve the net economic benefit they provide  (Marashlian and ElFadel,  2005).  Broadly  speaking,  business  models  and  MSW  management  methods,  such  as  the organisation of collection services, have received limited attention (Guerrini et al. , 2017).\\n\\nThese methods are crucial because they significantly impact the organisation of work (Allesch and Brunner,  2014),  and  both  controllable  and  noncontrollable  factors  can  significantly  impact  the costs of MSW management (De Jaeger and Rogge, 2013).\\n\\nFurthermore,  the  way  the  service  is  provided,  and  the  size  and  density  of  the  population  also affect  the  costs  of  MSW  management  due  to  economies  of  scale  (De  Jaeger et  al. ,  2011).  The characteristics of the waste produced also play an important role (Chifari et al. , 2017; Greco et al. , 2015). Worth remembering is that morphological and geographical factors (Passarini et al. , 2011), socioeconomic conditions (Mazzanti et al. , 2008), and policies and legal frameworks (Benito-L\\u00f3pez et al. , 2011) are also central to forming cost structures. Environmental objectives (Beccarello and Di Foggia, 2016), production technologies (Swart and Groot, 2015; Tisserant et al. , 2017), and the use of waste management facilities (Chu et al. , 2019) also play a role in this process.\\n\\nWith  respect  to  how  the  competitive  environment  and  business  strategies  influence  agility, adaptability, and alignment -which are linked, as reported by a recent study (Garrido-Vega et al. , 2021) -there  is  a  paucity  of  articles  focusing  on  the  strategic  behaviour  of  MSW  management firms. Some  studies  have  drawn  conclusions  concerning  the  degree  and  type  of  market competition (Bel and Seb\\u0151, 2020, 2021) .\\n\\n\\n## 3. Methodology\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3.1 Context\\n\\n\\nThe  waste  management  industry  is  a  hybrid,  regulated,  and  market-driven  sector  as  the  main activities  in  the  collection  phase  are  often  allocated  to  legal  monopolies,  whereas  those  in  the treatment phase, for example of waste electrical and electronic equipment (Roy et al., 2022), can mostly be fulfilled by the market.\\n\\nTherefore, analysing  economic  and  environmental  efficiency  based  on  identifying  economies  of scale  and  scope  is  particularly  complicated.  As  evidence  of  this,  the  results  in  the  previous literature do not necessarily reach the same conclusions. There are many reasons for this. Studies have  been  conducted  in  different  disciplines;  also,  the  type  of  cost  analysed  as  a  dependent variable  (e.g.  total  costs,  costs  of  separated  collection,  costs  of  nonsegregated  collection,  sales prices) differs depending on the context. The unit of analysis may contribute to the variance in the results, and the analysed phase plays a large role in this phenomenon.\\n\\nWe  refer  to  the  combination  of  the  transaction  cost  approach,  economies  of  scale,  and  the competitive  aspects  that are becoming  increasingly  important  in  defining  how  the  MSW management industry should function.\\n\\nThe idea of transaction costs is applied in many contexts, from simple situations to more general ideas that consider various methods for allocating resources and coordinating economic activity (Klaes, 2016). Transaction costs are a necessary first step in separating the factor market from the product  market.  It  may  be  impossible  to  distinguish  between  markets  in  service  industries characterised by a supply chain with a significant number of suppliers. Therefore, distinguishing one  organisation  from  another  is  often  difficult  when  decisions  are  contractually  binding. Furthermore,  transaction  costs  are  often  difficult  to  measure  and  separate  by  type  (Cheung, 2016).\\n\\nTransaction  costs,  like  production  costs,  are  a  wide-ranging  designation  for  a  heterogeneous assortment of inputs and transaction functions that may show diminishing, constant, or increasing returns;  in  general,  economies  of  scale  are  often  pronounced.  Compared  to  a  theoretical  state without  transaction  costs,  transaction  costs  inevitably  reduce  social  welfare  due  to  the  loss  of allocative  efficiency  they  incur.  Efficiency  problems  also  arise  in  a  more  general  context.  As complicated transactions may include multilateral contracts with many parties, transaction costs tend to increase (Niehans, 2016).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nFigure 1 is a theoretical approximation of how transaction costs can be delineated within the twostage  waste  chain.  Figure  1a  represents  an  integrated  provider  operating  at  both  levels  of  the supply chain. Figure 1b represents a market structure characterised by several firms that, as in the case  of  an  integrated  system,  operate  in  several  stages  of  the  supply  chain.  In  this  case,  the concessionaire must manage contracts with some firms, which, as it is a public service, must be provided at the same level of quality for all citizens. Figure 1c represents a market structure in which multiple firms specialise in services that take place in only one phase of the supply chain. In this  case,  a  similar  situation  to  that  described  in  Figure  1b  arises;  however,  not  only  is  a coordination point necessary at a horizontal level in the same phase of the supply chain but also\\n\\nan additional element is added consisting of the provision of a service in only one phase of the supply chain. Figure 1d generalises different configurations. Please note that the cases presented in Figure 1 do not include all possible configurations.\\n\\nThe phases that make up this network industry as well as the main functions -and consequently the different services within the two resulting phases -can be seen in Figure 2.\\n\\nFigure 2. Waste management chain\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nFigure 2 shows operations in one or more phases. Figure 2 also includes an additional phase (the generation  of  urban  waste),  as  it  is  increasingly  important  in  organising  citizen  activities  that extend beyond mere communication and awareness campaigns. The two arrows are significant. The arrow in the upper part of Figure 2 shows the path of waste; that in the lower part reflects the circular economic process.\\n\\nTherefore, the relationship between efficiency and economies of scale is more important at both policy  and  market  organisation  levels,  and  thus,  the  number  of  relevant  studies  on  the  cost  of MSW management  has  increased  (P\\u00e9rez-L\\u00f3pez et  al. ,  2016;  Sarra et  al. ,  2017).  The  economic literature has often focused on the determinants of demand for MSW management services (DiazFarina et  al. ,  2020),  organisational  forms  and  mode  of  supply  (Zhang et  al. ,  2015),  and  cost structures of MSW management (Callan and Thomas, 2001; P\\u00e9rez-L\\u00f3pez et al. , 2016) as well as the need to develop MSW management strategies to achieve sustainability goals.\\n\\n\\n## 3.2 Research design\\n\\n\\nThe analyses were developed at two levels to increase the robustness of the results; two research questions were developed to investigate this topic.\\n\\nRQ1: What is the relation between the size of the service and the cost? An econometric analysis based on 54% of Italian municipalities was developed to identify the impact of the determinants of MSW  management  costs.  Then,  a  sensitivity  analysis  of  different  samples  was  performed  by dividing the sample into 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 subsamples. The hypothesis is an inverse relationship between scale and cost.\\n\\nRQ2: Which factors impact the optimisation of MSW management services? A case study was used to test the best option between assigning MSW management to a single firm or dividing the city into four lots and assigning the service to four firms. The observed cost was reclassified, based on the 56 subservices (see Annex 1 for additional details) that constitute the service. An alternative scenario in which four firms provide MSW management services was simulated for comparative purposes.\\n\\nThis scenario first considered the organisational structure of the incumbent, which is divided into four branches referring to four subareas of the city of Milan. Then, a hypothetical total cost was calculated, based on the four existing operating divisions. The case study analysis aimed to shed light  on  the  operating  and  organisational  factors  that  have  received  little  attention  thus  far  in MSW  research  on  scale  and  scope.  The  hypothesis  is  that  a  single  contractor  is  expected  to provide MSW management services more efficiently due to organisational issues and transaction costs.\\n\\n\\n## 3.3 Data collection and variables\\n\\n\\nThe official data from the municipal waste cadastre published by the Italian national environmental protection institute (ISPRA) and openly accessible from the ISPRA web portal were used  to  run  the  analyses.  The  cadastre  database  contains  data  referring  to  the  cost  of  MSW management,  treatment  options,  and  waste  production  at  the  municipality  level.  Similarly,  the data available in the public balance sheets of the city of Milan were used. Only municipalities with available  data  were  included  in  the  sample.  The  morphological  and  geographical  data  were retrieved  from  the  Italian  Statistics  Institute  portal,  which  contains  the  data  on  all  Italian municipalities, which are publicly available for download. We aimed to increase the robustness of the  analysis  at  the  subsample  level  by  rerunning  the  econometric  analysis  using  comparable municipalities by size, as reported in the sensitivity analysis.\\n\\nTable I contains the key statistics for the variables used in this analysis. The data refer to 2019, as it was the last available certified period at the time of data collection.\\n\\nTable I: Variables\\n\\nFigure 3. Correlation between the main variables and their relative distribution\\n\\nNote. Correlation matrix, scatter plot, and density of the main variables used in this analysis.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n\\n## 4. Empirical Evidence\\n\\n\\nFigure  4  shows  the  relationship  between  costs  and  the  scale  of  services.  As  this  relationship  is influenced by organisational dynamics, the scale of services and costs appear inversely related.\\n\\nFigure 4. Scale and costs of MSW management\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n\\n## 4.1 Econometric analysis\\n\\n\\nApplying the model in Equation (1) and shown in Table 2, the determinants of  the variations in MSW management costs  with  respect  to  organisational  size  were  examined.  Other  conditions, such  as  the  specific  demographic  and  morphological  characteristics  of  the  territory  (which, together with the industrial structure of the waste treatment phase, influence MSW management costs), were considered. Furthermore, whether the average cost of MSW management tends to decrease as the population increases was checked. In Equation 1, the dependent variable is the average  cost  of  management  (Eurocents  per  kg),  while  the  independent  variables  are  the population, size of the area in which the service is provided, percentage of separated collection, population density, and altitude, as well as being a coastal municipality or otherwise.\\n\\nEquation 1: Econometric analysis\\n\\nThe equation is reiterated in three variants, as shown in Table II, which contains three columns corresponding to the three models, specifically:\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Model 1 refers to the total cost of the MSW management service;\\n- \\u00b7 Model 2 refers to the management costs of sorted waste;\\n- \\u00b7 Model 3 refers to the management costs of residual waste.\\n\\nRegarding  Model  1,  Figure  5  shows  the  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  performed  to  test  the robustness of the results.\\n\\nTable II: Econometric analysis\\n\\nConsidering the results shown in Table III, it appears that an inverse relation between the scale of the service and the cost exists in the types of costs considered when developing the three models.\\n\\nFigure 5. Average cost reduction due to scale\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nNote: see Annex 2 for additional details.\\n\\nFigure 5 presents a sensitivity analysis of the elasticity of the average cost of production in terms of the amount of waste handled, which seems to confirm the general hypothesis that asserts that the  MSW  sector  tends  to  be  characterised  by  economies  of  scale.  The  coefficient  for  the  full population  was -0.46.  As  the  number  of  intervals  increases,  the  coefficient,  although  based  on limited data, tends to increase. At this point, we conduct a comparative evaluation of the cost of collection and transport of the main Italian cities, which represents the segment of urban MSW management  most  affected  by  the  dynamics  of  company  organisation  and  the  consequent optimisation of services. Such an analysis allows a comparative assessment based on a scenario defined by subdividing the city of Milan into four subareas to simulate the organisation of MSW management services and examine the impact of transaction costs.\\n\\nGiven that the analysis is limited to the main Italian cities and a small number of observations, we proceed with a bottom-up approach that reconstructs the costs using information published on\\n\\nthe  website  of  the  Municipality  of  Milan,  including  the  2019  financial  statements  of  the incumbent,  explanatory  notes,  and  the  service  contract  between  the  Municipality  and  the incumbent. The scenario in which four firms provide MSW management services would imply a 6% increase in production costs compared to that of the incumbent.\\n\\n\\n## 5. Discussion\\n\\n\\nEconomies of scale can play a significant role in defining business models even though they may seemingly  conflict  with  the  common  knowledge  that  policymakers  should  favour  SMEs  in  the provision of public services to create new opportunities and support the growth of SMEs, which in turn can make a significant economic contribution. It is worth emphasising that the involvement of SMEs  in  public  procurement  allows  contracting  authorities  to  broaden  their  base  of  potential suppliers  and  to  benefit  from  the  increased  competition  for  public  contracts.  However,  such positive  externalities  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  market  development  gains  vanish  in  certain circumstances. Indeed, the arguments regarding the presence of economies shall be contextualised to fit with the cases. Considering that a few studies have stated that the existence of scale economies, to a certain level, does not indicate that it can be generalised to all cities. In fact,  most  studies  have  analysed  samples  only  with  no  or  just  a  few  large  municipalities.  In contrast,  this  article  deeply  analyses  the  MSW  cost  structure  in  a  1.38-million  inhabited  city, suggesting that the MSW service is large and complex enough to require specific analyses.\\n\\nIn cities where public or private incumbent monopolies have long-run MSW management services, policymakers should not allow for excessive exemptions, such as splitting a city's area into several subareas to allow more firms to participate in MSW management. Nevertheless, it is possible to argue that splitting the municipal area into several subareas or the MSW management service into subservices  each,  or  some  of  them  corresponding  to  many,  may  encourage  anti-competitive strategies. This action limits the number of lots in which a single economic operator can run the service  and  may  even  lead  to  covert  agreements  between  competitors,  which  would  in  turn worsen social welfare, for example, due to transaction costs (Cheung, 2016; DaSilva and Trkman, 2014) that have received little attention in MSW management studies.\\n\\nAnalysing the city of Milan enabled the determination of the efficiency of the business model by including  costs  sourced  from  public  information  regarding  the  incumbent,  and  the  results conveyed  that  a  single  firm  was  more  efficient  than  four  firms.  The  main  reasons  highlighted include  the  differences,  especially  regarding  the  separated  collection  of  materials  (e.g.  streetsweeping  activities  and  bin-emptying  activities),  given  that  the  production  factors,  employees, means of production, and containers required are proportional in the two scenarios analysed in this article. However, this study found several issues related to transaction costs. Furthermore, the results indicate that the incumbent is more efficient from an economic standpoint.\\n\\nThe services causing the greatest cost burden are those related to collection, which include the sorting  of  bulky  waste,  durables,  batteries,  pharmaceuticals,  and  spent  toner  cartridges,  the collection of residual and differentiated waste with dedicated containers, the collection of residual and  differentiated  waste  in  cemeteries,  the  cleaning  of  markets,  the  collection  and  disposal  of small  items  containing  asbestos,  the  separated  collection  of  used  clothing,  the  separated collection of used oil, and some sweeping activities such as cleaning the banks of watercourses, collecting  leaves,  cleaning  tree  rows  and  their  areas,  mowing  and  weeding  pavements,  and washing tunnels, arcades, and subways. Similarly, other activities, including on-demand services, have been shown to experience a significant increase in costs. Some production factors are not divisible or shareable between firms, which would entail the duplication of that production factor and therefore its cost.\\n\\nEvidence suggests that entrusting MSW management services to a single firm may positively affect the community given the potential cost savings (-6%) and, thereby, the waste tax that citizens pay to  finance  them.  The  main  drivers  increasing  production  costs  are  the  need  for  personnel  and means of production -namely, vehicles -to provide the same level of service if they were to be provided  by  several  firms.  The  above  results  are  correlated  with  strategic  management  and uncertainty-coping strategies, given that uncertainty plays a substantial role in strategic decisionmaking processes and increases the risk and ambiguity of innovation (Beraha et al. , 2018), which is needed to improve the performance of the MSW management industry.\\n\\nInterestingly, a recent study focusing on the city of Barcelona showed that dividing the region into four  lots  discriminated  in  terms  of  quality  and,  furthermore,  differentiated  service  quality.  The study  analysed  the  effects  of  competition  by  focusing  on  the  strategic  behaviour  of  firms  and illustrated  the  incentive  to  strategically  determine  the  quality,  based  on  the  operating  distance from competitors, which is an approximation of competitive pressure. This is, therefore, a risk if the principle of universality of service quality is to be respected. It is important to avoid triggering strategic behaviours  that  increase service quality only in the most  relevant  and  directly comparable areas (Bel and Seb\\u0151, 2021).\\n\\nHowever, both positive and negative aspects  should  be noted  to exist even when  a  single  firm provides the service, as shown in Table III.\\n\\nTable III. Alternative scenarios Table III. Opportunities of alternative scenarios\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Reduction  of  transaction  costs  resulting from fewer contracts;\\n- \\u00b7 Equity  and  same  quality  of  the  service provided to citizens.\\n- \\u00b7 Technological innovation given that positive linkages between size and innovation can occur in presence of high sunk costs.\\n- \\u00b7 Quality standardization that derives from the same organization of inputs.\\n- \\u00b7 More symmetric information and performance comparison among competitors\\n- \\u00b7 Low  market  concentration  that  if  not properly regulated may lead to inefficiency  in  the  medium-term  due  to the loss of market attractivity for potential efficient firms.\\n- \\u00b7 Reduced risks of market foreclosure.\\n- \\u00b7 level playing field.\\n- \\u00b7 Economies  of scale especially in the collection phase.\\n\\nThe results also provide information on the compatibility of such strategic behaviour of firms with the principle of universality of service. This is an essential element and a principle that cannot be derogated from and a risk that may emerge. A further risk lies in the information asymmetries between  local  authorities  and  contractors,  which  could  reduce  the  efforts  of  the  latter  in neighbourhoods farthest from those where there is more competition.\\n\\nThe main contribution of this paper is threefold. From a theoretical perspective, it summarises the previous literature on economies of scale and scope in MSW management and provides thoughtprovoking results that further the discussion on competitive policy and the regulation of public services. From a managerial perspective, the results offer new insights into critical organisational and operating factors that may emerge in running such services, which, due to transaction and other costs, may lead to suboptimal levels of output and economic inefficiency. This paper also has policy  implications  given  that  the  abovementioned  considerations  can  serve  as  a  reference  for public decision-makers in designing municipal strategies that consider economic and social welfare outcomes. Managerial and practical perspectives are also straightforward for both bit utilities and SMEs, which shall analyse in detail the organisational and transaction costs they may experience in running this service in complex circumstances.\\n\\nOur results also suggest that additional research is needed to evaluate the relation between scale and MSW management costs, which is a public service of general interest. Its effectiveness should be evaluated from a contracting authority -often municipality -perspective, not only from the firm perspective, paying more attention to the exogenous factors affecting the organisation of the\\n\\nservice.  Indeed,  failing  to  consider  the  above  may  result  in  formally  correct  results  but  bias  in practice  if  the  subadditivity  of  costs  is  not  considered.  In  fact,  a  paradox  may  emerge.  When analysing samples of firms the results of relatively small-scale economies may suggest the optimal size  that,  if  put  into  practice  in  relatively  large  cities,  resulted  in  multiple  firms  operating conjunctively, paving the way to transition costs and organisational failures that lead to negative externalities: one pitfall relates to costs, and the other downside refers to different quality levels that may occur in different parts of the cities because the service is run by different companies, and  other  hypothetical  problems  emerge  in  the  potential  strategic  behaviour  of  firms  and difficulties in regulating more firm issues.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n\\nThis  paper  investigates  the  scale  and  scope  of  MSW  management  business  models  in  terms  of their economic efficiency to provide empirical evidence to support both the debate and the design of competitive waste management policy strategies. On one hand, it is generally recognised that the broad participation of SMEs in the provision of public services is a public policy goal. On the other hand, monopolistic competition outperforms other models in certain circumstances -for example,  in  that  of  integrated  utilities,  which  can  provide  more  services  at  more  stages  of  the supply  chain,  owing  to  economies  of  scale  and  scope  resulting  from  their  optimised  and streamlined production models.\\n\\nA novel contribution of this paper is in its effort to analyse and test the same hypothesis across different conditions. From a national perspective, based on an econometric analysis of a significant sample of Italian municipalities, the results confirm the presence of an inverse relation between the scale and the average cost of the service. This finding is important considering that as the size of the service increases by 1%, the average cost of MSW management services decreases by 0.46% nationwide.  From  the  results,  the  inverse  relation  between  service  scale  and  costs  can  also  be inferred to persist even under different hypotheses, as confirmed by our scenario analysis.\\n\\nTo fine-tune the analysis and provide useful insights that benefit managers and local administrators,  a  simulation  has  been  carried  out  for  the  city  of  Milan  by  testing  whether  the service costs were lower when run by a single firm compared to when run by four different firms. The evidence suggests that MSW management is more efficient when carried out by a single firm given the industry structure, resource and labour force optimisation, and lower transaction costs, which,  in  certain  circumstances,  overcome  the  efficiency  gains  of  the  market,  envisaged  by economic theory.\\n\\nThe  simulation  revealed  that  dividing  the  city  into  subareas  may  lead  to  diseconomies,  thus undermining economic efficiency and general service quality and creating undesirable consequences for social welfare and the equal treatment of citizens. Therefore, there are  cases where contracting authorities shall decide that it is not appropriate to divide the contract into lots\\n\\ndue  to  the  risk  of  rendering  the  execution  of  the  contract  excessively  technically  difficult  or expensive and because coordinating the different contractors could risk undermining the proper execution of the contract to the detriment of equity and quality.\\n\\nThis  study  has  certain  limitations.  The  results  are  extendable  and  relevant  to  other  cities  only when the spatial and socioeconomic characteristics are comparable given that the factors used to identify whether a single firm is more efficient can lead to varied results in cities characterised by nonhomogeneous conditions or in larger multicentric cities. In fact, the land of the city of Milan is flat,  with  an  altitude  of  approximately  130  metres,  on  an  administrative  area  of  approximately 181.7  square  kilometres,  with  a  population  of  slightly  less  than  1.4  million  inhabitants:  7,315 inhabitants  per  square  kilometre.  Consequently,  a  very  different  situation  with  respect,  for example, to Rome: approximately 2,860,889 residents in 1,285 km 2 , 2.226 inhabitants per square kilometre, and varied land characteristics. In such urban conditions, the results in terms of optimal business  organisation  may  significantly  change,  preventing  our  results  from  being  extended  to geographically significantly different cities.\\n\\nIn  the  context  of  large  cities,  both  the  advantages  of  dividing  the  municipal  area  into  smaller subareas -or the service into more lots -to facilitate the potential entry of smaller operators and the a priori advantages related to the existence of economies of scale need to be further studied and contextualised to avoid a strategic drift in municipal waste service planning.\\n\\nThe  future  research  should  focus  on  two  topics.  First,  the  activities  that  comprise  waste management services should be broken down to investigate the opportunities presented by and costs  of  alternative  forms  of  management  for  each  subservice  according  to  scale  and  other exogenous factors. Second, provided that cross-sectional studies struggle due to sampling reasons, an analysis of the impact of economies of scale and scope in large cities is needed using case study approaches.\\n\\n\",\n          \"## Background\\n\\n\\nSocio-economic inequalities in common mental disorders (CMDs) such as lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation, and perceived treatment helpfulness have been documented in various settings. However, whether these inequalities are present globally (in both HICs and LMICs) and what factors explain between-country variation is unclear because of inadequate cross-national data. We therefore examine this question using a recently published global, individual-level survey data.\\n\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n\\nThis study uses a nationally representative individual-level survey dataset (Wellcome Global Monitor 2020), in 111 countries (N= 117,088) to test if socio-economic factors (household income quintile, education), psycho-social factors (local stigma perception, trust in health professionals) and country-level factors (GDP, Gini, health expenditure) predict (1) CMD lifetime prevalence, (2) utilisation and (3) perceived helpfulness of talking to a mental health professional and taking prescribed medication. Multi-level logistic regression models were used.\\n\\n\\n## Findings\\n\\n\\nAcross both HICs and LMICs, individuals in higher household quintiles are less likely to experience anxiety or depression (OR=0.90 for each increase in income quintile, 95% CI[0.89-0.91]), more likely to talk to a mental health professional (OR=1.05[1.03-1.07]) and more likely to perceive this treatment as 'very helpful' (OR=1.06[1.03-1.09]). Income is not, however, linked to utilisation (OR=0.98[0.97-1.01]) and helpfulness of taking prescribed medication (OR=1.02[0.99-1.05]). Perceived stigma reduces mental health professional utilisation (OR=0.93[0.90-0.97]) and helpfulness (OR=0.76[0.72-0.81]), while trust in health practitioners increases both utilisation (OR=1.10[1.06-1.14]) and helpfulness (OR=1.32[1.24-1.40]). Country-level health expenditure is related to higher mental health professional utilisation (OR=1.11[1.04-1.19].\\n\\n\\n## Interpretation\\n\\n\\nThis analysis reveals a global 'triple inequality effect', whereby the disadvantages of lower SES individuals persist in each outcome (lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and helpfulness). But these inequalities are moderated by background factors such as stigma and trust in health\\n\\nprofessionals, and depend on the type of treatment. These findings suggest that addressing inequalities in CMDs cannot focus on only one of these inequalities alone nor can efforts ignore the social context in which they are embedded.\\n\\n\\n## 1. Research in Context\\n\\n\\n\\n## Evidence before this study\\n\\n\\nWe conducted searches in Google Scholar and PubMed for publications up to February 2023 on papers coving cross-national work on social inequalities in mental health. We used the terms such as 'global inequalities in mental health', 'socio-economic status and mental health',  'global mental health survey', 'mental health treatment gap', 'inequalities in mental health treatment utilisation', 'perceived treatment helpfulness for depression'. Our search finds a strong, crossnational evidence base on CMD prevalence based on the Global Burden of Disease studies. Further, we found a variety of studies based on the WHO World Mental Health surveys and the Eurobarometer surveys 2006 and 2010 that find evidence for within-country socio-economic inequalities in treatment utilisation. One study found evidence that education is linked to perceived treatment helpfulness. Research frequently identified stigma as a barrier for CMD treatment utilisation. However, the studies on treatment utilisation and treatment helpfulness are limited to datasets that cover less than 30 countries. So far, the biggest cross-national survey datasets on treatment utilisation are based on the EU's Eurobarometer surveys. Therefore, between-country variation and predictors as well as differences between LMICs and HICs could not be thoroughly examined. Further, we did not find any cross-national study that investigates social inequalities of different mental health outcomes (e.g., prevalence, treatment utilisation, and helpfulness) together in one study to identify how social inequalities deepen across different health outcomes.\\n\\n\\n## Added Value of this study\\n\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a new, global survey dataset that covers 111 countries (both LMICs and HICs) to investigate socio-economic and psycho-social inequalities in three different CMD health outcomes. It is also the first study covering a sufficient number of countries to investigate country-level predictors of treatment utilisation and helpfulness. Our analysis uncovers a global 'triple inequality effect' in CMD prevalence, treatment utilisation and perceived treatment helpfulness in both LMICs and HICs, whereby disadvantages for lower SES individuals persist and deepen at each health outcome. This effect is moderated by psychological and country-level factors: Our study is the first one to show that trust in health practitioners is highly associated with both treatment utilization and treatment helpfulness. Finally, we discovered a notable exception to the 'triple inequality effect' as it does not persist for pharmacological treatment: In LMICs, more affluent individuals were less likely to take prescribed medication when affected by anxiety or depression.\\n\\n\\n## Implications of all the available evidence\\n\\n\\nOur findings suggest that efforts to reduce mental health inequalities need to account for how socio-economic factors simultaneously influence a variety of related health outcomes and consider the social context in which such efforts are embedded. For the design of policies and scaling up mental healthcare, policy makers and health practitioners need to focus on social inequalities in several different health outcomes throughout the cascade of care. This study also points to the need to consider the root causes of social inequality to improve multiple health outcomes at the same time. Finally, this study shows that psycho-social factors such as stigma and\\n\\ntrust in health professionals not only determine treatment uptake, but also to the perceived benefit of treatment.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Introduction\\n\\n\\nCommon mental disorders (CMDs), which include depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders, are a primary cause of global disease burden  . 1\\n\\nNotably, CMDs are socially stratified. This becomes clear in the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and three related health outcomes: Individuals with lower SES (1) have a higher lifetime prevalence of CMDs, (2) are less likely to utilise professional treatment (3) are less likely to perceive treatment as helpful when they do receive it 2-4 . This sequence of socioeconomic inequalities suggests that inequalities deepen as individuals move from being affected to experiencing treatment outcomes. Besides socio-economic inequalities, psychosocial factors (e.g., stigma and attitudes) and country-level factors (e.g., economic conditions and healthcare spending) may play a role to determine who receives and who benefits from treatment 2,5 . While we have some evidence documenting these associations across countries, most of this work has been carried out almost entirely in high income countries 6,7 . Therefore, we do not know if socio-economic and psycho-social patterns in lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and perceived helpfulness exist universally, and what factors explain betweencountry variations. This study addresses this gap by investigating what socio-economic, psycho-social and country-level factors are correlated with these three health outcomes in a global survey across 111 countries.\\n\\n\\n## Socio-economic factors\\n\\n\\nOut of the different health outcomes in this study, the link between SES (income and education) and CMD lifetime prevalence the most thoroughly documented across country contexts as lower SES individuals are more frequently affected by depression and anxiety  . 8 Theories on the pathway between income and mental health identify material circumstances, psycho-social stress, and behavioural differences  . SES also affects treatment utilisation for 4\\n\\nCMDs  3 . Generally, only a minority of affected individuals receives minimally adequate treatment  . Evidence from the European Union and Switzerland suggests that those 9 individuals who do utilise treatment have higher educational attainment and income 5,10 . Lastly, SES is associated with treatment effectiveness. Two systematic reviews using studies from the US and Europe showed that the effectiveness of psychological therapies 11 and antidepressant treatments 12 is lower for low SES individuals. As an explanation, lower SES individuals might face more socio-economic stressors which cannot be relieved by treatment 13 . Besides treatment effectiveness, perceived helpfulness is as a patient-centred way to measure treatment outcomes 14 , that yields high levels of external validity (Edlund et al., 2015). Using data from WHO's World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative across 16 countries, researchers found that individuals with higher education perceive depression treatment as more helpful  . In summary, we do not know if the association between SES and mental health 2 outcomes is stable across all country contexts. We hypothesise that SES is associated with lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and helpfulness in both HICs and LMICs (H1).\\n\\n\\n## Psycho-social factors\\n\\n\\nMental health stigma and negative help-seeking attitudes are well-documented barriers for utilising CMD treatment and explain part of the relationship between SES and treatment utilisation 16 . Stigma is a particularly widely studied barrier to treatment-seeking, with crossnational evidence stemming from the 2006 and 2010 Eurobarometer surveys  . Other psycho7 social factors gained less attention. Qualitative evidence suggests that trust in mental health practitioners and services is an important determinant of help-seeking 17,18 . However, trust has not been examined in quantitative, cross-national studies. Psycho-social factors might also be associated with the abovementioned measure of perceived helpfulness. The implications of outcome expectations and associated placebo effects for pharmacological treatments and talking therapy are well documented 19 . However, whether stigma or trust in health\\n\\npractitioners are correlated with perceived treatment helpfulness has not been investigated across countries. Again, cross-national evidence on treatment utilisation and helpfulness is limited to European countries, and the role of trust is under-researched. We hypothesise that stigma and trust in healthcare professionals are associated with treatment utilisation and helpfulness across a sample of 111 countries (H2).\\n\\n\\n## Country-level factors\\n\\n\\nLifetime prevalence of CMDs varies across country contexts. The Global Burden of Diseases study shows that HICs tend to have a lower prevalence than LMICs  . Regarding treatment 1 utilisation, the size of mental health treatment gaps varies depending on country-level economic and healthcare capabilities. The WMH Survey Initiative shows that 36% of people affected by anxiety disorders utilise treatment in HICs, and only 13% in lower-middle-income countries 20 . Evidence on country-level variations in healthcare utilisation is based on the Eurobarometer surveys 2006 and 2010. In Europe, healthcare spending and the available mental healthcare workforce explain cross-national variation in antidepressant use  . 5\\n\\nCountry-level variation in treatment helpfulness is not well-documented. The only two studies on this topic using the WMH Survey Initiative involved too few countries to include specific country-level predictors 2,21 . Surprisingly, patients in LMICs reported a higher treatment helpfulness for antidepressants than in HICs 21 . However, it is unclear if national-level differences in healthcare spending or quality-of-care influence treatment helpfulness. We hypothesise that GDP, health expenditure and lower out-of-pocket health expenditure are associated with higher treatment utilisation and helpfulness (H3).\\n\\n\\n## Study rationale and hypotheses\\n\\n\\nOverall, there is a lack of global cross-national evidence to understand the within and between country variations of three central CMD health outcomes (lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and treatment helpfulness). Using an individual-level survey dataset in 111\\n\\ncountries, we investigate if socio-economic and psycho-social inequalities in the three health outcomes exist universally, and what factors explain between-country variation.\\n\\nThere are two main reasons for studying the three health outcomes together. First, we cannot fully understand the mechanisms behind inequalities in the burden of disease by studying single health outcomes if inequalities exacerbate over different health outcomes. Research on infectious diseases and depression 22,23 used cascades of care approaches to examine at what points of the treatment journey patients drop out. Here, we apply this thinking to CMDs and examine three major health outcomes (who is affected, who receives treatment and who perceives treatment as helpful), while our interest is in understanding inequalities at each step. Notably, we focus three key health outcomes in many countries, instead of a larger healthcare cascade in one specific context. Second, differences in the determinants of the three health outcomes might have differential implications on what policies are needed to reduce health inequalities. Studying the outcomes together in one study can make such differences explicit.\\n\\n\\n## Hypotheses\\n\\n\\nIn summary, existing work in this area suggests 3 hypotheses relevant to our main research objective.\\n\\nH1(SES). Lower SES individuals have a higher CMD lifetime prevalence, are less likely to utilise professional treatment and to perceive this treatment as helpful, irrespective of HIC/LMIC country context.\\n\\nH2(Psycho-social) . Lower levels of stigma perceptions and higher levels of trust in health practitioners is associated with higher treatment utilisation and perceived helpfulness. H3(Country-level/Macroeconomic). Higher GDP and health expenditure, and lower out-of- pocket health expenditure are associated with higher treatment utilisation and helpfulness.\\n\\n\\n## 3. Methods\\n\\n\\n\\n## Sample\\n\\n\\nThe data was collected via telephone between August 2020 and January 2021 by Gallup commissioned by the Wellcome Trust. The dataset is publicly available online, alongside research and methodology reports 24 . The dataset included representative population-based surveys in 113 countries. Two countries were exluced because in Tajikistan, the mental health items were not included and in Venezuala, the variable on participants' household income is missing which is central to estimate socio-economic inequalties. Therefore, the final sample included 111 counties and 117,088 participants (see supplamentary Table S9). Data collection was situated in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Survey development was concluded before the pandemic and data collection had started before being interrupted in March 2020. Yet, the conclusions of this study aim to be relevant beyond the pandemic's context: All outcome variables used in this study refer to lifetime experiences rather than pandemic-related events.\\n\\nVariables\\n\\n\\n## Dependent variables\\n\\n\\nLifetime prevalence of anxiety or depression was measured using a single item 'Have you ever been so anxious or depressed that you could not continue your regular daily activities as you normally would for two weeks or longer' with 'Yes' or 'No'  The item was designed by . Wellcome Trust researchers considering the general diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression with the goal to elicit analytical comparisons across country-contexts and cultures (rather than epidemiological precision of prevalence) 24 . The item underwent cognitive testing to fulfil this purpose of cross-country comparability. Respondents who reported lifetime experience with anxiety or depression were asked about two types of treatment utilisation: 'When you were feeling so anxious or depressed, did you ever do any of the following to\\n\\nmake yourself feel better? Talk to a mental health professional' and 'Take medication prescribed by a healthcare professional' ('Yes' / 'No'). Both items underwent cognitive testing in 10 countries to confirm interpretability across countries. This showed that 'talking to a mental health professional' was interpreted by the participants in a variety of ways such as 'talking to a therapist, doing talk therapy, or talking to a mental health professional' . Similarly, for 'taking prescribed medication', the type of medication was intentionally left open.\\n\\nThose who answered treatment utilisation questions with 'Yes' were questioned on their perceived treatment helpfulness \\\"Did you find the following very helpful, somewhat helpful, or not helpful in making you feel better?' regarding both treatment types (3= Very helpful , 2= Somewhat helpful , 1= not helpful ). To ensure consistency of interpretation and effect sizes across all statistical models (see Figure 1 and Table 2), categorised ' not helpful ' and ' somewhat helpful ' together as ' not entirely helpful ' (contrasted with the category ' very helpful '). Sensitivity tests showed that results remained stable compared to the original coding (see supplementary Table S8).\\n\\n\\n## Socio-economic factors\\n\\n\\nOut of the different health outcomes in this study, the link between SES (income and education) and CMD lifetime prevalence the most thoroughly documented across country contexts as lower SES individuals are more frequently affected by depression and anxiety  . 8 Theories on the pathway between income and mental health identify material circumstances, psycho-social stress, and behavioural differences  . SES also affects treatment utilisation for 4\\n\\nCMDs  3 . Generally, only a minority of affected individuals receives minimally adequate treatment  . Evidence from the European Union and Switzerland suggests that those 9 individuals who do utilise treatment have higher educational attainment and income 5,10 . Lastly, SES is associated with treatment effectiveness. Two systematic reviews using studies from the US and Europe showed that the effectiveness of psychological therapies 11 and antidepressant treatments 12 is lower for low SES individuals. As an explanation, lower SES individuals might face more socio-economic stressors which cannot be relieved by treatment 13 .

Using data from WHO's World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative across 16 countries, researchers found that individuals with higher education perceive depression treatment as more helpful  . In summary, we do not know if the association between SES and mental health 2 outcomes is stable across all country contexts. We hypothesise that SES is associated with lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and helpfulness in both HICs and LMICs (H1).\\n\\n\\n## Psycho-social factors\\n\\n\\nMental health stigma and negative help-seeking attitudes are well-documented barriers for utilising CMD treatment and explain part of the relationship between SES and treatment utilisation 16 .

First, a random intercept model without fixed effects established that the probability of lifetime prevalence and treatment utilisation vary as a function of countries (see Appendix A). Next, fixed effects for both individual and country-level predictors were added to the random intercept model, resulting this following model:\\n\\n## \\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61(\\ud835\\udc38\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc50\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc34\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57)\\n\\n- = \\ud835\\udefe00 +\\ud835\\udefe01 \\u00d7 \\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc56 \\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udefe02 \\u00d7 log(\\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc43) \\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udf070\\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udefe10 \\u00d7\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc50\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5a\\ud835\\udc52 \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57\\n- + \\ud835\\udefe20  \\u00d7 \\ud835\\udc38\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc50\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57 +\\ud835\\udefe30  \\u00d7 \\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udefe40  \\u00d7 \\ud835\\udc34\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udf00\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57\\n\\nThis model was adjusted according to the variables in Table 2. For each outcome variable, we condition on the answer \\\"Yes\\\" in the previous question. Therefore, sample sizes of the different regression models vary as shown in Table 2. For the multi-level models, survey weights were applied to yield representative samples within each country. We control for age and gender as important covariates in the mental health literature   and ran several models  to 5 confirm the robustness our results (supplementary Tables S3-S8).\\n\\n\\n## 4. Results\\n\\n\\nFigure 1 summarises descriptive statistics, segregated by HICs and LMICs. Overall, 20.1% of participants reported lifetime experience with anxiety or depression. 8.6% of participants report talking to a mental health professional and 9.6% report taking prescribed medication. The mean helpfulness of both forms of treatment was high ( M= 2.56 for mental health professional utilisation and M= 2.47 for prescribed medication). Most participants rated both treatment types as 'very helpful'.\\n\\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics\\n\\n\\n## Socio-economic factors (H1)\\n\\n\\nH1 states that individual-level SES is associated with higher lifetime prevalence, lower treatment utilisation and lower helpfulness. We used both household income quintile and education as outcomes to test this hypothesis.\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the predicted probability of experiencing anxiety or depression, utilising treatment, and rating this treatment as very helpful as a function of within-country income quintiles (based on simple general linear models). The top three graphs illustrate that higher income levels are associated gradually lower lifetime prevalence, higher mental health professional utilisation and higher perceived helpfulness of talking to a mental health professional in both HICs and LMICs. The lower two graphs show that this social gradient is not found for taking prescribed medication and perceived helpfulness of this treatment. Notably, in LMICs, higher income is associated with a lower likelihood of taking prescribed medication.\\n\\nThe findings are confirmed by the regression models displayed in Table 2. The table contains one statistical model for each dependent variable. A series of further models affirm the robustness of these results (see Tables S3-S8). As shown in Table 2, an increase in one within-country household income quintile is related to a significantly lower probability of experiencing anxiety or depression (OR=0.90; 95% CI[0.89-0.91]), a higher likelihood of mental health professional utilisation (OR=1.05[1.03-1.07]), and a higher likelihood of rating this treatment as very helpful (OR=1.06[1.02-1.09]). In contrast, income is not significantly linked with utilisation (OR=0.98[0.96-1.01]) and perceived helpfulness of taking prescribed medication (OR=1.02[0.99-1.05]). The effects for education follow the same pattern and are displayed in Table 2 and supplementary Figure S3. All results remained stable when using regression models with the 'helpfulness' outcomes on a scale from 1 to 3 (see Table S8).\\n\\nFigure 1.

Values reflect unstandardised regression coefficients; * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01. Sample size varies according to the number of people who were asked each survey questions (see methods)\\n\\n\\n## Psycho-social factors (H2)\\n\\n\\nH2, which states that psycho-social factors are associated with treatment utilisation and helpfulness, is confirmed by the results shown in Table 2. Perceived stigma (OR=0.93[0.900.97]), belief in science to treat mental health conditions (OR=1.08[1.05-1.12]) and trust in health professionals (1.10[1.06-1.14]) all predict mental health professional utilisation and also significantly predict the utilisation of prescribed medication in the same direction (see Table 2). Similarly, perceived stigma (OR=0.76[0.72-0.81]) and trust in health professionals (OR=1.32[1.24-1.40]) also predict the perceived helpfulness of both types of treatment in the hypothesised direction. Again, the effects are also stable for the utilisation of medication (see Table 2). Thus, these results did not yield the same differentiation between treatment types as shown for socio-economic factors. The results remained stable when removing the socioeconomic predictors (see Tables S3-S8).\\n\\n\\n## Country-level factors (H3)\\n\\n\\nH3 states that country-level economic and healthcare factors explain between-country variation in the health outcomes. Table 2 highlights several significant country-level effects. Higher income inequality (Gini) is associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety or depression (OR=1.02[1.004-1.03]). GDP (OR=1.26[1.08-1.47]) and health expenditure (OR=1.11[1.04-1.19]) are related to higher mental health professional utilisation. In contrast, for utilisation of prescribed medication, such country level effects were small and not significant. Unexpectedly, higher GDP is related to lower perceived helpfulness of both types of treatment (OR=0.78[0.68-0.91] for mental health professional utilisation and OR=0.81[0.70-0.93] for medication). Country-level out-of-pocket health expenditure was not associated with treatment utilisation and its association with perceived helpfulness of medication (OR=0.99[0.98-0.999] did not (unlike the other abovementioned country-level predictors) remain stable throughout alternative models (see supplementary Tables S3-S7).\\n\\n\\n## 5. Discussion\\n\\n\\nThis study used a survey dataset in 111 countries to investigate within and between country inequalities in the three mental health outcomes of CMD lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and perceived treatment helpfulness.\\n\\nThis study demonstrates that socio-economic inequalities cut across the three health outcomes of prevalence, mental health professional utilization, and perceived helpfulness in both HICs and LMICs. Firstly, in line with previous research individuals with lower SES (income and education) have a higher lifetime prevalence of anxiety and depression 4,8 . Secondly, individuals with higher SES are more likely to talk to a mental health professional when they are affected by anxiety or depression. These results indicate that higher SES individuals are more likely to engage in talking therapy and specialist mental health care. This is in line with Europe-based research on treatment utilisation for mental health services 3,10 and specialist medical healthcare 26 . Thirdly, talking to a mental health professional was perceived as more helpful by higher SES individuals. As potential explanations, talking therapy might be better tailored to the needs of those higher education 27 and might more readily provide perceivable progress for individuals without poverty related pressures 13 . In conclusion, these findings point to a global 'triple inequality effect', whereby disadvantages of lower SES individuals deepen along each of the three health outcomes.\\n\\nHowever, this 'triple inequality effect' was only shown for the utilisation of mental health professionals, and not regarding utilisation and perceived helpfulness for pharmacological treatments. SES had no significant association with utilisation with taking prescribed medication in HICs, while in LMICs, the reversed social gradient was shown for utilisation. In LMICs, richer and more educated individuals were less likely to take prescribed medication when affected by anxiety or depression. Different explanations for these effects can be considered. First, antidepressant medication tends to be cheaper and easier to access for both healthcare\\n\\nproviders than specialist care and talking therapy 5,28 . Therefore, income might not be an important determinant for medication. Relatedly, medication is often prescribed by primary health care professionals 29 which is - opposed to specialist care - is more frequently used by lower SES individuals 26 . As a second potential explanation, the item to measure treatment utilisation might have been interpreted differently across countries. As the survey item did not specify what type of prescribed medication was taken, the types of pharmacological treatment might differ between HICs and LMICs. As in LMICs, depression and anxiety are particularly strongly underdiagnosed, people reporting with CMD symptoms might be treated for their somatic symptoms  30 . In such cases, higher SES individuals might be less likely to take such potentially unsuitable medication. Future research needs to differentiate between the specific types of treatment and find explanations for the different socio-economic effects.\\n\\nBesides stigma perceptions, trust in healthcare professionals was identified as predictors for treatment utilisation. Especially with the sensitive topic of mental health, trust is an important condition to disclose personal problems and seek help 18 . This finding highlights the importance to increase trust between patients and healthcare providers. Interestingly, stigma and trust were also associated with perceived helpfulness of both treatment types. Thus, treatment helpfulness might be influenced by psychological factors that shape expectations and interactions during the treatment. Conversely, a successful therapy might influence perceptions of stigma and trust. Future research should attempt to disentangle these two alternative causal pathways.\\n\\nThis paper extents previous findings on national-level treatment variation in Europe 5,7 and shows that GDP and health expenditure are important predictors of treatment utilisation globally. The richer a country, the more likely are its citizens to access mental health specialists. However, health expenditure and GDP do not explain cross-national variations in the use of medication in this study. As highlighted earlier, this might be because providing\\n\\nand using medication requires fewer country-level financial resources than providing specialist mental healthcare. Surprisingly, higher GDP is negatively associated with perceived treatment helpfulness of both types of treatment. Based on H3, we expected that higher country-level economic resources would entail with higher service availability and quality of care, and therefore relate to higher treatment satisfaction. Previous findings also indicate that antidepressant treatments were perceived as more helpful in LMICs than HICs 21 . Possibly, richer countries might have higher expectations in treatment helpfulness which are harder to fulfil. This effect should be thoroughly investigated in future international research.\\n\\nSeveral limitations should be highlighted. First, the study uses cross-sectional data and memory recall for lifetime events, which make the results prone to response biases. Second, the data collection during Covid-19 might have changed the salience of mental health related topics. Third, the item to measure lifetime experience of anxiety or depression was designed to allow international comparisons of lifetime experiences, but not clinically precise measurement. No distinction between anxiety and depression can be drawn as they are measured in one item. Forth, differences in the meaning for \\\"talking to mental health professional\\\" and 'taking medication prescribed by a healthcare professional' leave some uncertainty around the results as highlighted in the discussion. Future research should use longitudinal designs and distinctive measures for anxiety, depression, and treatment types to validate our findings.\\n\\n\",\n          \"## Introduction\\n\\n\\nThere is consistent evidence that the neighborhood children grow up in has a causal effect on school achievement and other life chances (e.g., Burdick-Will et al., 2011; Chetty &amp; Hendren, 2018; Chyn &amp; Katz, 2021; 2019; Wodtke, Harding, &amp; Elwert, 2011). Moreover, while much of the neighborhood literature has focused on exposure in adolescence, there is increasing evidence that exposure during the first decade of life also plays a significant role (Donnelly et al., 2017; Leventhal, 2018). For example, after reanalyzing the Moving to Opportunity data, Chetty et al. (2016) found that moving during childhood to a neighborhood with less poverty had positive effects  on  future  economic  outcomes,  while  moving  during  adolescence  had  none  or  even negative effects. Similarly, using neighborhood moves caused by housing demolition, Chyn (2018) found longterm effects when this happened early in children's lives. However, while these and other experimental and quasi-experimental studies have provided strong support for causality, they have come at the expense of more nuanced perspectives on heterogeneity in neighborhood effects (Sharkey &amp; Faber, 2014a).\\n\\nFew st udies examine whether neighborhoods affect children's development differently despite strong reasons for expecting such heterogeneity. Scholars from various disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, economics, and quantitative genetics, have all argued that neighborhoods affect different individuals in different ways as a function of their individual and family characteristics (Belsky et al., 2018; Chyn &amp; Katz, 2021; Galster, 2012; Harding, Gennetian, Winship,  Sanbonmatsu, &amp; Kling,  2011;  Leventhal,  Dup\\u00e9r\\u00e9,  &amp;  A.  Shuey,  2015;  Levy,  Owens,  &amp; Sampson, 2019; Sharkey &amp; Faber, 2014b). Hence, these scholars point to one of the paths forward for studying the effects of neighborhoods: to understand for whom neighborhoods matter.\\n\\nWhile  research  on  heterogeneity  in  sociology  and  economics  has  only  recently  gained traction (Levy, 2022), there is at least some convergence across disciplines in conceptions on how to define the for whom question, that is, what is the child- and family characteristics with which neighborhood effects should be expected to vary. Gender and family socioeconomic resources are key candidates. Moreover, individual biological and psychological vulnerability and resources, like  genetics,  have  also  been  hypothesized  to  differentiate  how  children  are  affected  by neighborhood socioeconomic conditions (e.g., Leventhal et al., 2015; Sharkey &amp; Faber, 2014b), known as 'gene environment interaction' in psychology and behavioral genetics -(Plomin, DeFries, &amp; Loehlin, 1977).\\n\\nIn this paper, we take a novel approach to studying heterogeneity in neighborhood effects by integrating population-wide data from national registries with genetic data from a large health survey.  Moreover,  we  use  a  state-of-the-art  approach  to  tackle  the  endemic  selection  into neighborhoods  by  incorporating  the  Neighborhood  Choice  model,  recently  developed  by  van Ham, Boschman, and Vogel (2018), as well as studying the effects of randomly occurring genetic variation  within  families. Specifically, we  examine  whether  the  impact  of  neighborhood socioeconomics on children's 5 th -grade test scores in reading and math depends on gender, family socioeconomics, and within-family genetics. Our registry data include information on each child's family income, parental education, migrant background, and test scores, as well as aggregate information  on  a  wide  range  of  socioeconomic  (SES)  characteristics  of  their  immediate neighborhoods. In the subset of analyses including genetics, we have coupled the population data with genetic data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) (70,000 parent-offspring  trios),  using  the  Educational  Attainment  Polygenic  Index  (EA4-PGI),  which measures  the  individual  child 's and  their  parents' load  for  genetic  variants  correlated  with educational attainment.\\n\\nWe find an overall effect of neighborhood SES on children's test scores, with a magnitude in the range of other studies (one SD difference in neighborhood SES is, on average, associated with about 6% of an SD higher test scores in our preferred model). Moreover, our main finding is considerable heterogeneity in these effects: boys are twice as affected by neighborhood SES as are girls, and children with lower SES backgrounds are more affected than children of higher SES backgrounds. Additionally, the neighborhood effects are stronger for children with a lower load for genetic variants correlated with educational attainment.\\n\\n\\n## Heterogeneous Effects of Neighborhoods: Theory and Evidence\\n\\n\\nIndividual  development  is  often  considered  to  be  embedded  in  the  wider  ecology  of neighborhoods,  where  individual  characteristics  and  biological  predispositions  interact  with developmental contexts (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Harding et al., 2011; Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Leventhal et al., 2015). From this perspective, the child's developmental outcomes should be considered as a function of individual vulnerabilities and strengths within the characteristics of the neighborhood they live in. Concerning the effects of neighborhood socioeconomics, this is expected  to  interact  with  both  risk  and  protective  factors  in  the  family  and  the  individual (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000). More specifically, Harding et al. (2011) argue that families and individuals differ in their susceptibility to risks in the neighborhood and their ability to benefit from  opportunities.  As  a  supplementary  perspective,  developmental  psychologists  have  also discussed  how  developmental  risk  and  resilience  in  the  family  and  for  the  individual  may contribute to heterogeneity in neighborhood effects (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Leventhal et al., 2015; Leventhal, 2018).\\n\\n\\n## Heterogenous Effects Across Families\\n\\n\\nFamilies  may  have  different  resources -financially  or  human  capital-wise -to  protect their children from  negative  influences  or  to take advantage  of  opportunities  in  their neighborhoods.  For  example,  compound  disadvantage theories  (e.g.,  Jencks  &amp; Mayer,  1990a) suggest that a lack of family resources makes children more receptive to negative neighborhood influences  because  the  family  lacks  the  capacity  to  insulate  their  children  from  exposure  to neighborhood  risks.  For  instance,  wealthier  families  have  the  resources  to  seek  out  more supportive  environments  (e.g.,  leisure  activities)  for  their  children  outside  of  the  immediate neighborhood, which could reduce the negative impact of growing up in disadvantaged areas for this group (see Wodtke, Elwert, &amp; Harding, 2016 for an updated review). In contrast, a lack of family  resources  may  prevent  children  from  being  able  to  take  advantage  of  developmental opportunities in their neighborhoods, particularly if they are more advantaged (Galster, 2012; Jencks &amp; Mayer, 1990b; Wodtke et al., 2016).\\n\\nAnother  perspective  of  SES  differences  builds  upon  relative  deprivation  theory.  Social contrast perspectives argue that students compare themselves to the relevant reference group, which  in  this  case  is  their  neighbors  (Crosnoe,  2009;  Marsh,  1987).  Thus,  children  of  low socioeconomic backgrounds who grow up in affluent areas may experience feelings of inferiority, shame,  and  dissatisfaction,  which  may  negatively  impact  their  development  and  well-being, thereby counteract some of the positive effects of the  affluent neighborhoods, such as highquality schools (DeAngelis, 2021; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2017).\\n\\nAlthough  some  regard  socioeconomic  background  as  a  univariate  concept,  it  is  more common to consider it multidimensional (Bukodi &amp; Goldthorpe, 2013; Mastekaasa &amp; Birkelund, 2022;  Thaning,  2021).   Moreover,  different  socioeconomic  dimensions  may  moderate  the 1 neighborhood effects. For example, Duncan and Magnuson (2003) have argued that income and education  may  affect  outcomes  through  distinct  mechanisms.  Parental  income  may  affect developmental outcomes through the capacity to invest in activities and educational opportunities both within and outside the neighborhood, as well as parental stress and parenting styles  (e.g.,  Yoshikawa,  Aber,  Bergman,  &amp;  Beardslee,  2012).  The  mechanisms  through  which parental education -seen as a measure of human capital -affects developmental outcomes may be through the home learning environment, educational aspirations, and conversational styles (Magnuson, 2007). These mechanisms may also include parent s' capacity to man euver within the neighborhood's con traints and opportunities to facilitate their child's development and well s -being, as well as their local network and (to some extent) hence the child's peers (Harding et al., 2011; Levy, 2022).\\n\\nA  few  studies  have  examined  whether  the  effects  of  neighborhood  socioeconomic conditions vary as a function of parental income and education. In nationwide US data, Wodtke et al. (2016) found that neighborhood disadvantage during adolescence had a stronger impact on\\n\\nhigh school graduation for adolescents from lower-income families, and more so than exposure during childhood. Similarly, Levy et al. (2019) found neighborhood disadvantage in Chicago to be strongly associated with lower attainment of a bachelor's degree, but only for blacks and Latinos, with  no  effect  for  whites.  In  Norway,  Borgen  and  Zachrisson  (2023)  found  that  8 th grade standardized tests  of  children  from  less  educated  and  affluent  families  are  more  affected  by neighborhood disadvantage than their more privileged peers. These studies support a compound disadvantage theory.\\n\\n\\n## Heterogenous Effects Across Children\\n\\n\\nA basic tenet in developmental psychology is that children's individual differences shape development within the wider ecological context (Overton &amp; Molenaar, 2015). Gender has been one key marker of individual differences in neighborhood research. The neighborhood context constitutes  a  source  of  socialization,  with  the  socialization  processes  depending  on  gender (Harding, 2009). Because boys are expected to receive less parental monitoring, they are more exposed  to  influences  from  outside  of  the  family.  Thus,  boys  should  be  more  sensitive  to neighborhood influences than girls (Leventhal et al., 2015). Specifically addressing educational achievement,  Leventhal  et  al.  (2009)  review  nonexperimental  studies  and  conclude  that achievement for boys is more affected by neighborhood characteristics than for girls.\\n\\nHowever,  experimental  and  quasi-experimental  studies  find  the  opposite  pattern. Analyses of the Moving To Opportunity (MTO) experiment showed positive effects on educational outcomes for girls but not for boys (Kling, Liebman, &amp; Katz, 2007).  A subsequent investigation explained this through girls' better ability to adapt to neighborhood norms and navigate the new neighborhood (Clampet-Lundquist, Edin, Kling, &amp; Duncan, 2011). Supporting the notion that girls benefit  more  than  boys  from  moving  away  from  highly  disadvantaged  neighborhoods,  Chyn (2018) mainly found positive effects on future incomes among girls. However, these findings may not be generalizable to the wider context of neighborhood influences, as they stem from children moving from extremely disadvantaged neighborhoods to (at least somewhat) more affluent ones (Chyn  &amp;  Katz,  2021).  In  sum,  the  current  literature  is  inconsistent  with  regard  to  gender differences in neighborhood effects.\\n\\nClassical  neighborhood  research  rarely  theoretisize  nor  empirically  studies  whether neighborhood effects vary based on individual susceptibility or genetic background (Sharkey &amp; Faber,  2014a).  However,  social  sciences  studies  covering  various  topics  are  increasingly incorporating genetic data (Mills &amp; Tropf, 2020), and there is a long research tradition examining gene-environment interactions. Gene-environment interactions have traditionally been studied indirectly  using  twin  methods,  but  more  recently  using  polygenic  indices,  which  measure individual-level propensity to a trait using DNA data (Plomin &amp; Viding, 2022).\\n\\nOf the various theoretical gene-environment models, the literature often tests the notion that  disadvantaged  environments,  as  opposed  to  more  advantaged  ones,  suppress  genetic influences. Most  famously, Sandra Scarr argued that genetic factors largely explained developmental  outcomes  within  the  normal  range  of  environments,  while  in  extremely disadvantaged  environments,  genes  mattered  less  (Scarr-Salapatek,  1971).  More  generally, positive  environments  are  seen  as  an  enhancement  that  accentuates  advantageous  genetic predispositions (Shanahan &amp; Hofer, 2005). From the neighborhood perspective, this would imply that neighborhoods matter more for children with high genetic potential for education.\\n\\nHowever,  other  theoretical  models  lead  to  contrasting  hypotheses,  suggesting  that neighborhood  disadvantage  activates  negative  genetic  predispositions.  For example,  the diathesis-stress model proposes that some individuals have a genetic makeup that increases their risk  of  adverse  outcomes  in  unfavorable  environments.  In  contrast,  others,  less  genetically vulnerable individuals, are less affected (Boardman et al., 2014). The same predictions can be made  based  on  the  compensatory  advantage  model  (Bernardi,  2014).  Based  on  these perspectives, we may expect that children with genetic vulnerabilities for low achievement are most affected by growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\\n\\nThe gene-environment interaction literature has mainly focused on parental socioeconomic status (e.g., Baier &amp; Lang, 2019; Erola, Lehti, Baier, &amp; Karhula, 2021; Ghirardi, GilHern\\u00e1ndez, Bernardi, van Bergen, &amp; Demange, 2023; Isungset et al., 2021; Ruks, 2022) and, to a somewhat lesser extent, school characteristics (Cheesman et al., 2022a; Cheesman et al., 2022b; Stienstra, Knigge, &amp; Maas, 2024; Trejo et al., 2018). The results vary between contexts, with little evidence from family SES-gene interactions in Europe (Baier et al., 2022; Tucker-Drob &amp; Bates, 2016).\\n\\nLess is known about how neighborhoods and genetic potential for education interact. One study by Silva, Wolfram, and Tropf (2023) used the National Child Development Study from the United Kingdom to examine neighborhood-by-gene interaction for individuals born in the same week in 1958, which was followed up to the late 1970s. They found that after holding school SES constant, the gap between individuals with high and low scores on the educational attainment PGI was smaller in socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods than in less advantaged ones.\\n\\nHowever, the interaction between genetic predispositions and school SES was in the opposite direction, suggesting that attending a school with high SES enhances genetic differences.\\n\\nAdditionally, one Norwegian study, using partly the same genetic data as ours, showed that the effects of polygenic index for educational attainment varied at the school but not at the neighborhood level (Cheesman et al., 2022a). However, that study used multilevel models to estimate the total effects of social context and looked at neighborhood effects net of any school effects, in a context where children predominantly attend local schools. In contrast, we consider any school effects, including gene-environment interactions, as part of the total neighborhood effect (Wodtke &amp; Parbst, 2017). Moreover, since the previous Norwegian study, the number of genotyped individuals has more than doubled, which reduces the risk of erroneously concluding that there is no gene-environment interaction.\\n\\n\\n## The Norwegian Context\\n\\n\\nAlthough wealth inequality is comparably high (Hansen &amp; Toft, 2021; Pfeffer &amp; Waitkus, 2021), Norway is often considered a relatively egalitarian country, with low levels of income inequality, redistributive welfare state institutions, and high rates of intergenerational mobility. Moreover, in relative terms, economic segregation is low in Norway (Musterd, 2005). However, there are tendencies toward increasing segregation patterns (Markussen &amp; Roed, 2018; Wessel, 2016), and a  considerable  proportion of  individuals are  continuously  exposed  to either dense poverty or dense affluent areas, especially in large urban areas (Toft, 2018).\\n\\nThere  is  considerable  variation  in  neighborhood  characteristics  in  our  data  (the  data section provides details about variable construction). For example, as shown in Figure 1, looking at Norway as a whole, 1% of children live in neighborhoods where 17% of adults are on social welfare, compared to nearly none on welfare in the most advantaged neighborhood. Likewise, among the most disadvantaged communities, nearly 70% have low education, compared to less than 10% in the most advantaged areas.\\n\\nFigure 1: Distribution of neighborhood characteristics in Norwegian data.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nNote: Details of variables are provided in the data section. Each variable is divided into 100 equal pieces, and the mean is calculated within each piece. This graph shows 4 of 9 neighborhood characteristics studied; Appendix Figure A3 shows the distribution for all neighborhood variables used in this paper.\\n\\nSome earlier studies have examined neighborhood effects in Norway. 2  Using sibling fixed effects, Markussen and Roed (2018) found that neighborhood socioeconomic composition has a\\n\\nhump-shaped impact on grade point average at age 15-16, suggesting that children growing up in medium-ranked neighborhoods had the best outcomes. Moreover, they found that girls were more affected than boys and that low-income children were unaffected by the neighborhood. However,  unlike  standardized  tests,  teacher-assessed  grades  are  influenced  by  within-school grading on a curve, which may inflate (deflate) grades in areas with many low (high) achieving students (Borgen, Borgen, &amp; Birkelund, 2023; Calsamiglia &amp; Loviglio, 2019). Norwegian studies examining standardized test scores have not found a hump-shaped pattern. Rather, they find a negative effect on attending disadvantaged neighborhoods, with stronger neighborhood effects for boys and children from less educated and affluent families (Borgen &amp; Zachrisson, 2023) and lower neighborhood effects for children of non-western immigrant groups than natives (Borgen, Borgen, &amp; Zachrisson, 2024).\\n\\nOther  studies  have  focused  on  Oslo,  the  capital  of  Norway,  where  neighborhood segregation  is  most  pronounced  (Hern\\u00e6s,  Markussen,  &amp;  R\\u00f8ed,  2020),  using  more  traditional covariate  adjustment  strategies.  Brattbakk  and  Wessel  (2013)  found  a  small  influence  of neighborhood  deprivation  during  adolescence  on  later  education,  income,  and  employment. Concerning affluent neighborhoods, Toft and Ljunggren (2016) found that living in upper-class neighborhoods during adolescence was associated with a higher likelihood of attending higher education and gaining upper-class membership, especially for working-class youth.\\n\\n\\n## Data and Variables\\n\\n\\nWe use Norwegian register data covering individuals born in Norway between 1997 and 2008 (approx. 650,000 children), 3 which are matched with genetic data on parents and children from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) (approx. 62,000 children). Neighborhood  units  are  defined  based  on  Statistic  Norway's  detailed  'Basic  Statistical  Unit' classification, which are stable geographical units designed to resemble genuine neighborhoods and are relatively homogeneous concerning location and type of housing. There are about 14,700 neighborhood units in Norway, with about 350 individuals in each unit.\\n\\nWe  measure  the  socioeconomic  composition  in  these  neighborhood  units  using  all individuals born between 30 and 60, including non-parents, separately for each year. First, we calculate  the  neighborhood  characteristics  using  the  following  indicators:  percent  on  social welfare,  percent  on  a  disability  pension,  percent  receiving  housing  allowance,  percent higher educated,  percent  school  dropout  (non-completion  of  upper  secondary  education),  percent among top 10% income, percent among bottom 10% income, average earnings rank. Second, we calculate  the  children's  average  neighborhood  characteristics  when  aged  1 -10.  Third,  we  use principal component  analysis with these SES indicators to produce  our socioeconomic neighborhood  disadvantage  variable  (mean=0  and  standard  deviation=1).  As  expected,  the socioeconomic neighborhood indicators are correlated (Appendix Table A1). Moreover, using the separate indicators in place of the principal component score produces similar estimates, as does taking a simple average of the indicators (Appendix Figure A1).\\n\\nWe use the average of standardized national 5 th -grade tests in reading (Norwegian) and mathematics as the primary outcome variable, which are compulsory tests designed to capture the  full  range  of  subject  skills  among  5 th -graders.  Test  development  is  commissioned  by  the Directorate of Education and Training and carried out by subject experts at universities in Norway along with psychometric experts in the Directorate. About 96% of all students in Norway take the standardized test; students with special needs and those following introductory language courses may be exempt.\\n\\nGenetic variables are from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort (MoBa) Study (Magnus et al., 2006). MoBa is a population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants were recruited from all over Norway from 19992008. The women consented to participation in 41% of the pregnancies. The cohort includes approximately 114.500 children, 95.200 mothers, and 75.200 fathers. The establishment of MoBa and initial data collection was based on a license from the Norwegian Data Protection Agency and approval  from  The  Regional  Committees  for  Medical  and  Health  Research  Ethics.  The  MoBa cohort  is  currently  regulated  by  the  Norwegian  Health  Registry  Act.  The  current  study  was approved  by  The  Regional  Committees  for  Medical  and  Health  Research  Ethics  (project  # 2017/2205).\\n\\nAll women giving birth in Norway from 1999 to 2008 in hospitals and birth units with more than 100 births annually were invited to participate in MoBa, and we have access to data from children born between 2002 and 2008. For the present study, MoBa was linked (through person identification numbers) with Norwegian administrative records provided by Statistics Norway. We have access to genetic data for about 16% of the full birth cohorts, ranging from 10% among the\\n\\n2002 cohort to 19% in the 2006 cohort (Appendix Figure A4). Appendix Table A4 shows the sample characteristics of children included in MoBa compared to those born in Norway. This appendix table  shows  that  families  with  lower  income  and  education  levels,  and  those  residing  in socioeconomically  deprived  areas,  are  underrepresented  in  MoBa.  However,  the  bivariate associations between independent and outcome variables are similar in the MoBa sample and the comparable  full population (Appendix Table A5). Thus, although there is a slight overrepresentation of middle-class families in the MoBa, the similarity of associations suggests that selection into the MoBa sample does not bias associations.\\n\\nGenetic analyses were conducted on a subsample of parent-offspring trios with complete data for genome-wide genotyping. Online Appendix B describes our quality control of the MoBa genetics data. We generated EA4-PGI for all 207,283 parents and children in MoBa who passed the quality control, based on genome-wide association summary statistics excluding 23andMe and MoBa samples. We used the PRSice software to calculate scores using all SNPs (i.e., p-value threshold of 1), with clumping parameters kb=500, p=1, r2=.25. We computed mid-parental PGI by taking the average maternal and paternal PGI. PGI for children from independent families and mid-parental PGI (hereafter 'parental PGI ') w as then centered to have mean zero and standard deviation one. In all gene-environment analyses, we included parental PGI as controls, such that the effects of offspring PGI are within-family direct genetic effects (further described below).\\n\\nRegister-based control variables include a dummy for being girl (=1), dummies for year of birth, a dummy for having an immigrant background (at least one foreign-born parent), quadratic functions of parental earnings rank (at child age six, separate for father and mother), dummies for parents receiving welfare benefits (age six, separate for father and mother), housing benefits\\n\\n(age six, separate for father and mother), unemployment benefits (age six, separate for father and mother), and disability pension (age six, separate for father and mother), and dummies for educational level (9 dummies, separate for father and mother).\\n\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n\\nUnobserved confounding has been a concern in the neighborhood literature for decades (Mayer &amp; Jencks, 1989). The main threat has been that families sort into affluent neighborhoods based on characteristics that also positively influence children's learning (Chyn &amp; Katz, 2021). We use the recently developed two-step Neighborhood Choice model to solve this challenge to causal inference (Schachner &amp; Sampson, 2020; van Ham et al., 2018) under an assumption of selection on  observables  (Morgan  &amp;  Winship,  2015,  pp.  79-81).  This  modeling  approach  first  creates correction terms that measure families' propensity to sort into particular neighborhoods and then controls  for  these  correction  terms  in  a  linear  regression  model.  The  following  two  sections explain these two steps.\\n\\n\\n## Neighborhood Choice Model\\n\\n\\nThe  neighborhood  choice  model  is  based  on  the  idea  that  a  family  with  certain (observable)  characteristics  will  choose  to  live  in  a  neighborhood  with  certain  (observable) characteristics  (van  Ham  et  al.,  2018).  By  modeling  this  selection  into  neighborhoods,  it  can subsequently be used to rule out selection bias in the regression model.\\n\\nWe estimate neighborhood correction terms separately for all Norwegian municipalities using a conditional logit model. We have records of all possible census tracts parents may move to each year within each municipality. B ased on the mother's residential moves, we fin d the year of the family's last neighborhood move. T hus, we know which families that change census tracts during our observation period, as well as all available census tracts (within the municipality) to which they can potentially move to. We then estimate the likelihood \\ud835\\udc43 that family \\ud835\\udc56 will select neighborhood \\ud835\\udc57 based on the interaction between  family characteristics ( \\ud835\\udc7f ) and the characteristics of the \\ud835\\udc57 th neighborhood ( \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc57 ) in a within-family model. Family characteristics we include  are parents'  average  age, parents'  average  number  of  kids,  parents'  average  years  of education,  parents'  average  income,  at  least  one  parent  born  abroad,  parents  receive  social welfare,  parents  receive  disability  pension,  parents  receive  housing  allowance,  and  parents receive unemployment benefits.\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nWith  this  model,  we  can  predict  the  probability  that  family \\ud835\\udc56 selects  any  of  the \\ud835\\udc58 neighborhoods based on the family's socioeconomic background. Following van Ham et al. (2018), we  transform  these  predicted  probabilities  into  inverse  Mills  ratios  before  using  principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the predicted probabilities into a fixed set of orthogonally rotated correction terms.\\n\\nBoth  computational  and  substantial  considerations  guide  our  choice  to  estimate  the neighborhood  choice  model  separately  by  the  municipality. With approximately  13,000 neighborhoods  and  440,000  families,  it  is  computationally  unfeasible  to  estimate  selection models for the  entire  country,  as  this  would  mean  estimating  a  conditional  logit  model  on  a sample of 5.7 billion observations. From a more substantive standpoint, we also expect that the relevant choice set considered by parents is primarily within the municipality, especially in large urban municipalities, where the neighborhood sorting is strongest.\\n\\nThe number of within-municipality choice sets differs between municipalities, and so do the corresponding types of neighborhoods that households may sort into. As a result, the number of  correction  terms  is  typically  larger  in  urban  municipalities  with  considerable  variation  in neighborhood characteristics than in more sparsely populated areas. To make sure we use all available information in the correction terms, we replace the remaining correction terms with random  noise  for  municipalities  and,  as  explained  below,  interact  correction  terms  with municipality fixed effects.\\n\\n\\n## Neighborhood Effects Model\\n\\n\\nIn the second step, the correction terms are used in the neighborhood effect model to account for the household's propensity to reside in a certain type of neighborhood. Specifically, we estimate the neighborhood effects by regressing test scores \\ud835\\udc66 on the neighborhood composite ( \\ud835\\udc41 ) and  the  control  variables.  The  control  variables  include  municipality  fixed  effects  ( \\ud835\\udefc ), interactions  between  municipality  fixed  effects  and  the  neighborhood  correction  terms  ( \\ud835\\udefc \\u2217 \\ud835\\udc43\\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc34 ), and some additional individual-level covariates (year of birth, birth month, gender, and in some models, child and parental EA4-PGI):\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n, where   and   index individual and cohort. \\ud835\\udc56 \\ud835\\udc57\\n\\nThe  interactions  between  the  correction  terms  and  the  municipality  fixed  effects constitute an important part of this model. Since we model the neighborhood choice within the separate municipalities, the values of the correction terms cannot be directly compared between municipalities. Including municipality fixed effects and allowing the coefficients of the correction terms to vary by municipality solves this challenge.\\n\\n\\n## Treatment Effect Heterogeneity Models\\n\\n\\nWe examine heterogeneous neighborhood effects using interaction variables. We include neighborhood  interactions  between  neighborhood  disadvantage  and  parental  education, parental earnings rank, gender, and child EA4-PGI:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n, where \\ud835\\udc40\\ud835\\udc56 is shorthand for the separate moderators. This model allows us to check whether, for example,  children  of  low-educated  parents  are  more  strongly  influenced  by  neighborhood characteristics than children of high-educated parents. When estimating the interaction with EA4PGI, we control for parental EA4-PGI. This within-family PGI model controls for the non-random selection of neighborhoods by parents (Cheesman et al., 2022a).\\n\\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics.\\n\\nNote: Correlations=Bivariate correlations between neighborhood and variable.\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n\\n\\n## Average Neighborhood Effects\\n\\n\\nThe neighborhood socioeconomic composition is strongly associated with students' test scores;  a  one  standard  deviation  increase  in  the  neighborhood  disadvantage  composite  is associated with a decrease in national test scores by 21% of a standard deviation (column 1 in Table 2). To contextualize the size of this association, let us compare achievement gaps between the most advantaged and least advantaged neighborhoods with the corresponding gap between wealthy  and  low-income  families.  Figure  2  demonstrates  a  difference  of  about  one  standard deviation  in  test  scores  between  the  most  and  least  affluent  neighborhoods  (1.06  standard deviations), which is close to the achievement gap among children of the richest and poorest parents (about 1.2 standard deviations).\\n\\nFigure 2: Bivariate associations between neighborhood disadvantage and standardized test scores (left) and parental earnings (right).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nAlthough the neighborhood children grow up in is strongly associated with achievement outcomes in childhood, not surprisingly, a large part  of the achievement differences between neighborhoods  are  driven  by  sorting.  Still,  after  accounting  for  sorting  via  the  neighborhood choice model, the neighborhood's socioeconomic composition has a sizeable influence on test scores: a one standard deviation increase in the neighborhood disadvantage composite reduces reading scores by about 5.5% of a standard deviation (column 2 in Table 2).  These results mean 4 that  compared  to  growing  up  in  the  most  advantaged  areas,  growing  up  in  the  most\\n\\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods leads to about 22% of a standard deviation lower achievement (i.e., comparing -2SD with +2SD). Translated into percentile points, this effect size involves moving a student who scores at the median to the 58 th percentile. 5\\n\\nTable 2: Estimated neighborhood effect on national test scores.\\n\\nNote: Standard errors clustered on neighborhood in parentheses. Parental education is centered at 10 years. Model (1) shows the bivariate association between neighborhood disadvantage and test scores, while models (2)-(6) show estimated neighborhood effects using the Neighborhood Selection Model. In models (3)-(6), interactions with gender, parental education, parental earnings, and EA4-PGI is included. These models also controls for the main effects of the variable going into the interaction. Further, model (6) includes controls for parental EA4-PGI.\\n\\n\\n## Heterogeneous Neighborhood Effects\\n\\n\\nThe  neighborhood  effects  differ  considerably  by  individual  and  family  background characteristics, as shown in columns 3-6 in Table 2, with children with lower achievement levels most affected by growing up in a disadvantaged area. First, boys are considerably more affected by the neighborhood than girls; neighborhood SES affects boys' test scores by 6.8% of a standard deviation, compared to 4.1% among girls (column 3).\\n\\nSecond, the test scores of children of disadvantaged parents, as measured by parental education and earnings, are more affected by neighborhood than those of advantaged parents\\n\\n(columns 4-5). The estimated neighborhood effect at different levels of parental education and earnings is presented in Figure 3. Among children of parents who have completed compulsory schools  (9  years  of  education  for  the  parental  cohort),  a  one  standard  deviation  increase  in neighborhood disadvantage reduces test scores by 5.8%, compared to 3.4% among parents with a  master's degree (18  years  of education). Neighborhood effects heterogeneity is even more pronounced by parental earnings; comparing children of parents at the top and bottom of the earnings distribution, there is a difference in neighborhood effects of 7.2% and 0.4%.\\n\\nFigure 3: Estimated neighborhood effects at different levels of child genetics, parental earnings rank, and parental years of education.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nNote: Coefficients are based on the results in Table 2.\\n\\nFinally, children's polygenic index for educational attainment, as measured by EA4-PGI, significantly  moderates  the  neighborhood  effect  (column  6).  The  results  indicate  a  geneenvironment interaction where children with the highest load for genetic variants correlated with educational attainment are unaffected by neighborhood disadvantage.\\n\\n\\n## Robustness\\n\\n\\nThe neighborhood effects are estimated using the neighborhood choice model (Schachner &amp; Sampson, 2020; van Ham et al., 2018). We test the robustness of the results by including genetic controls  and  using  a  covariate  adjustment  strategy.  Table  3  shows  estimated  neighborhood effects using a covariate adjustment strategy, with the full register sample in columns 1 and 2, and the reduced neighborhood choice sample in column 3. The covariate adjustment strategy results  in  a  lower  neighborhood  effect;  a  one  standard  deviation  increase  in  neighborhood disadvantage reduces test scores by 4.7% of a standard deviation in the covariate adjustment model, compared to 5.5% in the neighborhood choice model (compare columns 2 in Table 2 and 3). The results in column 3 show that the neighborhood effects are nearly identical in the full register sample and the sample included in the neighborhood choice model.\\n\\nTable 3: Estimated neighborhood effects using a covariate adjustment strategy.\\n\\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses. Control variables include gender, year of birth, immigrant background, earnings rank, parents receiving welfare benefits, housing benefits, unemployment benefits, and disability pension, and dummies for parental educational level. Estimates in columns (1) and (2) are from the full register data, while the estimate from column (3) is from the sample included in the selection model. + p&lt;0.10, * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001\\n\\nWe also test the robustness of the results by including genetic controls. Because they capture only a small portion of the genetic effects, polygenic indices are better suited to study gene-environment  interactions  than  serving  as  control  variables.  Still,  there  are  clear  genetic sorting patterns in neighborhoods in Norway, as shown by the bivariate correlation in Table 1 and graphically  in  Appendix  Figure  A5.  Moreover,  although  child  and  parental  PGI  only  explain  a quarter of the twin heritability in education (which is ~ 40%), it is nevertheless a strong predictor of test scores compared to other background characteristics. For example, explaining 10% of the variation in test scores, child and parental PGI explains only slightly less than parental education (12.7%), and more than parental earnings rank (7%) (i.e., \\ud835\\udc45 2 in Table A3).\\n\\nThus, if genetic confounding exists, we expect the PGI controls to reduce the estimated neighborhood  effects.  In  Table  4,  columns  2  and  4  replicate  the  selection  and  covariate adjustment model in the MoBa genetics sample. The adjusted neighborhood effects are lower when estimated on the subsample where genetic controls are available (cf. columns 2 in Tables 2 and 3), suggesting some selection into the genetic sample. Additionally, including genetic control variables  reduces  the  estimated  neighborhood  effects  further,  suggesting  that  unobserved genetic confounding could slightly upwardly bias the main neighborhood effects. However, the estimates  are  still  statistically  significant,  and  the  smaller  sample  size  with  the  genetic  data introduces some uncertainty; the 95% confidence intervals with and without the genetic controls overlap.\\n\\nTable 4: Estimated neighborhood effects controlling for parental and child EA4-PGI.\\n\\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses. Only individuals observed in the MoBa genetics are included. Model (1)\\n\\nshows the bivariate association between neighborhood disadvantage and test scores in the MoBa sample, while models (2) and (3) show estimated neighborhood effects using the Neighborhood Selection Model and models (4) and (5) estimated using covariate adjustment model. Covariate adjustment controls are explained in the table note of Table 3. PGI controls in column (3) and (5) include parental and child EA4-PGI.\\n\\n- + p&lt;0.10, * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001\\n\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\n\\nThere is limited research on neighborhood effects on early school outcomes and even less research on for whom neighborhoods matter. Adapting the Neighborhood Choice Model of van Ham et  al.  (2018)  to  the  entire  country  of  Norway,  we  find  that  exposure  to  neighborhood disadvantage during a child's ten first years impacts test scores: compared to growing up in the most affluent areas, the children in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods get about 22% lower test  scores  in  fifth  grade.  Moreover,  we  find  that  boys  are  more  affected  by  neighborhood disadvantage than girls and that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more affected than advantaged groups. Additionally, our findings suggest that children with lower polygenic index for educational attainment are more affected by their neighborhood surroundings than other children.\\n\\nBy finding that neighborhood influences test scores, our study fits with extensive literature that finds that growing up in disadvantaged areas affects student outcomes (Leventhal, 2018;\\n\\nSharkey &amp; Faber, 2014a). To contextualize our findings, let us compare the neighborhood effect to  the  influence  of  parental  earnings  and  education.  Indeed,  the  family  environment  is  more influential than the more distal neighborhoods. Additionally, the family variables operate partly through neighborhood choice, which means that parental education and earnings capture the effects of both neighborhood and family environment. Nevertheless, the size of the estimated neighborhood  effects  is  15-20%  of  the  parental  earnings  and  education  coefficients;  a  one standard deviation increase in parental earnings and education is associated with an increase in test scores by 26.4% and 35.6% of a standard deviation (Appendix Table A3), compared to 5.5% for  neighborhood  disadvantage  score.   Thus,  neighborhoods  have  a  meaningful  influence  on 6 children's test scores.\\n\\nWhile previous studies have provided strong evidence of causality, less is known about how neighborhood effects vary by family background, gender, and individual traits (Levy, 2022; Sharkey &amp; Faber, 2014a). In our results, children of low socioeconomic backgrounds are most negatively  affected  by  growing  up  in  disadvantaged  neighborhoods.  This  finding  fits  with  US research showing more influential neighborhood effects on later-life outcomes for disadvantaged groups (Levy et al., 2019; Wodtke et al., 2016).\\n\\nIt is challenging  to  conclude  why  parental  socioeconomic  background  moderates neighborhood effects. However, one clue may be found in the fact that neighborhood effects vary more  with  parental  earnings  than  parental  education.  Parental  education  and  income  are correlated (Sands\\u00f8r et al., 2021) and are likely to influence the consequences of growing up in\\n\\ndisadvantaged  neighborhoods  for  many  of  the  same  reasons: parents'  capacity  to  maneuver within the neighborho od's constraints and opportunities to facilitate their child's development and  well-being,  home  learning  environment,  and  conversational  styles.  However,  parental earnings  are  a  better  predictor  of  parents   capacity  to  invest  in  activities  and  educational ' opportunities within and outside of the neighborhood, and a better predictor of parental stress.\\n\\nThere  has  been  mixed  evidence  on  whether  boys  are  more  negatively  affected  by neighborhood disadvantage than girls: while moving to opportunity types of studies have found stronger  effects  for  girls  than  boys  (Chyn,  2018;  Kling  et  al.,  2007),  nonexperimental  studies typically found the opposite (Leventhal et al., 2009). Our findings support the latter, suggesting that neighborhood disadvantage affects boys considerably more than girls.\\n\\nMoreover,  it  is  improbable  that  these  neighborhood-by-gender  interaction  effects  are biased.  Although  parents  sort  into  various  neighborhoods  based  on  partly  hard-to-observe personal  characteristics  and  resources,  the  child's  gender  is  independent  of  these  sorting processes; girls and boys are randomly distributed across neighborhoods (in the developmental period we investigate). This randomness essentially eliminates the concern that girls (boys) with specific characteristics are more likely to live in certain neighborhoods, allowing us to estimate the  difference  in  neighborhood  effects  by  gender  credibly.  (For  neighborhood-by-gender interactions to be biased, boy parents must systematically move into different neighborhoods than  girl  parents  based  on  the  treatment  effect.)  Thus,  as  has  been  hypothesized  in  several studies,  the  gendered  processes  involved  when  children  and  youth  move  away  from  highly disadvantaged communities to more affluent ones may, in some ways, differ from the processes involved when growing up in disadvantaged areas (Chyn &amp; Katz, 2021; Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2011).\\n\\nTurning  to  genetic  dispositions,  we  find  that  children's  genetic  propensity  toward education significantly moderates the effect of growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods, with the  strongest  effects  among  children  genetically  likely  to  struggle  in  school.  This  finding contradicts  the  predictions  of  the  Scarr-Rowe  hypothesis  (Scarr-Salapatek,  1971),  where advantaged neighborhoods are assumed to provide the most stimulating environment, allowing children with a high genetic potential for education to express their advantages fully. Instead, our findings support the predictions of the diathesis-stress model, which proposes that genetically vulnerable children are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes in unfavorable environments, while less genetically vulnerable children are less affected (Boardman et al., 2014).\\n\\nFinding  that  neighborhood  effects  vary  by  genetics  is  hardly  surprising,  given  the compelling arguments for gene-environment interactions. Yet, the empirical literature, which has focused mainly on parental socioeconomic status, has been less consistent, especially in Europe (Baier  et  al.,  2022;  Tucker-Drob  &amp;  Bates, 2016).  A  few studies  have  examined gene-by-school interactions using polygenic indices (Cheesman et al., 2022a; Cheesman et al., 2022b; Trejo et al., 2018), but less is known about how neighborhoods and genetic potential for education interact. One exception is an earlier Norwegian study, which, contrary to our study, found that genetic liability for education did not vary at the neighborhood level (Cheesman, 2022). However, our results may differ from that study because it investigated neighborhood effects net of any school effects, and because it had access to a considerably smaller sample of genotyped individuals. 7\\n\\nThe case for the causal interpretation of our genetic neighborhood interactions is solid, although slightly more complicated than for the gender interactions. We use a within-family PGI design where the neighborhood-by-PGI interaction is estimated conditional on parents' PGI. In the  within-family  PGI  design,  the  child  PGI  reflects  the  random  segregation  of  alleles  at conception. The refore, the child's PGI is uncorrelated with the social environment the parents select (Cheesman et al., 2022b), and we can credibly estimate the gene-environment correlation using this within-family PGI design. However, measurement errors in the polygenic index are likely to attenuate the size of the gene-environment interaction (Pingault et al., 2022).\\n\\nTo conclude, using the Neighborhood Choice Model of van Ham et al. (2018), we find that exposure to neighborhood disadvantage during a child's ten first years has a meaningful impact on  5 th -grade  standardized  test  scores.  Moreover,  neighborhood  effects  vary  considerably  by socioeconomic  background,  gender,  and  polygenic  index  for  education,  highlighting  the importance of studying heterogeneous neighborhood effects. This negative effect of neighborhood disadvantage potentially compounds with individual risk (lower load for genetic variants  correlated  with  educational  attainment)  and  family  risk  (lower  family  income  and parental education levels) for underachievement at school, and potentially most strongly so for boys. Hence, our findings suggest that policies designed to improve opportunities and life chances\\n\\nfor these children should also incorporate interventions at the neighborhood level, to reduce neighborhood disadvantage or compensate for the detrimental effect of it.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This  trend  is  supported  using  subsets  defined  by  the  quantity  of  waste  managed. Multiple factors aid in explaining this result, and among others, due to scale and scope, factors such as transition costs increase with the number of players running different services.\\n\\n\\n## Practical implications\\n\\n\\nThe provision of public services of economic interest should favour the participation of more companies wherever possible to the extent that social surplus is produced. However, pursuing this principle to the detriment of efficient service  delivery  is  not  ideal.  This  paper  demonstrated  that  a  single-provider  waste  management  business  model  is efficient under specific conditions, as in this article.\\n\\n\\n## Originality\\n\\n\\nThis  paper  presents  an  original  research  methodology  for  comparatively  analysing  waste  management  service efficiency in urban areas and provides adequate evidence using alternative measures of costs according to the phase of the waste management chain, the scale, and ultimately the scope of municipal solid waste management services.\\n\\n\\n## 1. Introduction\\n\\n\\nPublic services of general economic  interest are fundamental  to the nation's economic development and significantly impact social welfare (Boggio, 2016). The operational efficiency of the  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  management  industry  has  become  increasingly  significant  for achieving sustainable development objectives (Zorpas, 2020). Business and governance models of MSW management need to evolve towards efficiency levels compatible with the achievement of economic and environmental objectives (Kaza et al. , 2018). Research has exposed the critical need for  assessing  different  models  of  governance  and  organisation,  and  entrusting  services  for  the governance  and  delivery  of  public  services  (Soukopov\\u00e1 et  al. , 2017).  Trade-offs  between  the competitive dimensions in industrial structures characterised by imperfect competition must also be considered.\\n\\nTypically,  local  authorities  can  choose  between  three  models  and  procedures:  entrusting  the service  to  third  parties  through  public  procedures,  the  provision  of  the  services  through  hybrid public-private  firms  and  in-house  provision.  Free  market  and  competition  rules  apply  to  actors entrusted  with  providing  public  services  for  economic  interests  as  long  as  these  rules  do  not prevent them from fulfilling their general mission (European Commission, 2022).\\n\\nAdditionally, the principle that underpins European competition and public procurement legislation  since  the  introduction  of  Directive  2014/24/EU  is  important,  which  is  to  encourage small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to participate in public procurement and, thereby, in the  provision  of  public  services.  However,  this  principle  can  be  abandoned  by  considering integrated utilities, which can provide more services at various stages of the chain, owing to the economies  of  scale  and  scope  resulting  from  their  production  efficiency.  Subdividing  large municipalities  can  be  assumed  to  lead  to  greater  competition,  fostering  growth  among  service providers  (Sarra et  al. ,  2020).  However,  on  the  contrary,  a  recent  empirical  study  focused  on Barcelona revealed that multiple firms can strategically interact to maximise producer surplus at the expense of social welfare (Be l and Seb\\u0151, 2021).\\n\\nMSW management can be regarded as  an  industry  with  two  or  more  intertwined  phases.  The market structure in the first phase is mainly labour-intensive, while the second phase is capitalintensive and supported by enabling infrastructure, such as waste treatment plants. Both phases are subject to the risk of market failure, and in certain circumstances, the market can effectively manage one or more services (Di Foggia and Beccarello, 2018).\\n\\nThe industrial  organisation  of the  collection phase  often  involves  local monopoly  configurations justified  by  the  economies  of  scale  resulting  from  the  size  of  the  service  and  its  economies  of scope  (AGCM,  2016).  Much  has  been  written  regarding  the  existence  of  scale  economies,  an important  issue  with  some  consensus  (Callan  and  Thomas,  2001),  as  confirmed  in  previous analyses  that  also  found  scale  economies  and  some  efficiency  differences  between  public  and private providers (Tickner and Mcdavid, 1986). Early research in the field of economies of scale focused on the interrelationships of scale, market structure, and costs, with scattered evidence in\\n\\nthe beginning, based on the little evidence of the existence of certain scale economies (Stevens, 1978).\\n\\nIn this regard, the more recent findings on economies of scale have provided mixed results. For example,  a  recent  study  found  that  less  than  half  (40.4%  of  the  municipalities  evaluated), presented  negative  economies  of  scale  (Llanquileo-Melgarejo  and  Molinos-Senante,  2021). Another study underscores the drivers of costs under alternative cost definitions (Di Foggia and Beccarello,  2020).  Similarly,  a  third  article  concluded  that  population  and  size  are  important factors for scale economies, and the implication is uncertain (Wowrzeczka, 2021). This uncertainty is  partly  due  to  information  asymmetries  that  complicate  comparative  analyses.  Another  factor that concurs with mixed results is the unit of analysis.\\n\\nIndeed, many studies aimed at understanding the economies of scope in MSW management by focusing on the input factors of firms and very different output variables, failing to differentiate among collection costs, total costs, and treatment costs or using per capita cost against costs per unit of waste.\\n\\nScale  economies  in  a  public  service  of  general  interest  such  as  waste  management  should  be evaluated from the perspective of the contracting authority, paying more attention to exogenous factors affecting the organisation of the service that must be used at the same level as the input factors of firms. Indeed, failing to consider the above may result in formally correct results but be biased  in  practice  if  the  subadditivity  of  costs  is  not  considered.  Consequently,  the  contracting authorities  may  decide  it  inappropriate  to  divide  the  contract  into  lots  to  avoid  the  risk  of rendering the execution of the contract excessively technically difficult or expensive and because coordinating the different contractors for the lots could risk undermining the proper execution of the contract.\\n\\nSome scholars have empirically evaluated the impact of different regulated business models on MSW management and suggested that their efficiency can  be  increased  by  limiting  the  size  of these service areas so that the system encourages large service providers to compete for service allocation  in  a  large  number  of  small  areas,  thus  intensifying  the  positive  effects  of  market competition (Sarra et al. ,  2020). However, it could be argued that reducing the size of the areas that can be allocated to a single firm may promote anti-competitive strategies aimed at creating divisions between several theoretically competing operators.\\n\\nStrengthening market competition and realising economies of scale by integrating organisations (and  thus  reducing  the  number  of  individual  economic  actors)  can  be  considered  appropriate choices for achieving economic and environmental efficiency. First, this idea is supported based on an econometric model that identifies the main determinants of service costs. Then, the focus was on the analysis of multiple case studies, using a sample consisting of the ten most populous Italian\\n\\ncities. Third, a single case comparing a 'business -asusual' model involving a single economic actor with an alternative scenario consisting of four firms was analysed.\\n\\nEvidence suggests that as the size of the service increases, the average cost tends to decrease. The case  study  confirms  the  presence  of  economies  of  scale,  resulting  from  the  specific  factors employed in the production of the service.\\n\\nThe rest of the article is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review and reports on the previously published studies that have explained some of the aspects analysed in this article. Section 3 describes the context and research design as well as the data collection process and the variables in this study. Section 4 presents the results of the econometric analysis and case studies. Section 5 discusses the main considerations and implications arising from  the findings. The final section concludes.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Background and literature\\n\\n\\nThe complexity of the WM industry raises concerns about the technologies it relies upon and the sustainability of its business models (Bj\\u00f6rklund et al. , 1999), which also depend on how contracts between MSW management providers and institutions are structured (Walls, 2005). In light of the challenging  environmental  goals,  the  efficiency  of  MSW  management  business  models  has become an increasingly important concern (Kinnaman, 2009); thus, their sustainability as well as their  emergent  role  in  local  communities  is  critical  (Avil\\u00e9s-Palacios  and  Rodr\\u00edguez-Olalla,  2021; Esmaeilian et  al. ,  2018).  As  such,  the  relationship  between  efficiency  and  economies of  scale  is attracting  more  attention  at  both  the  political  and  the  organisational  levels.  Accordingly,  the number of studies on the cost of MSW management has grown, such as the analysis of the cost functions (Bohm et al. , 2010) or the cost of recycling environmental policies (Da Cruz et al. , 2014).\\n\\nPrevious literature has focused on the determinants of demand for MSW management services (Diaz-Farina et  al. ,  2020),  organisational  forms  and  modes  of  supply  (Zhang et  al. ,  2015),  policy implications (Goddard, 1995), cost structures (Callan and Thomas, 2001; P\\u00e9rez-L\\u00f3pez et al. , 2016), and the need to develop strategies to achieve sustainability goals. Regarding sustainability goals, geopolitical contingencies  make  it  difficult  to reach  the  binding  agreements  and  credible commitments made by policymakers (Darus et al. , 2020).\\n\\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to analyse the economic efficiency of MSW collection firms.  For  example,  a  recent  study  identified  a  relation  between  costs  and  environmental efficiency, although this relationship is nonlinear, as a rise in the separated waste collection rate increases total costs by a less-than-proportional amount, which provides evidence of the existence of economies of scale (Bartolacci et al. , 2019).\\n\\nEconomic  and  technical  efficiency  have  emerged  as  prominent  factors  in  explaining  costs  (lo Storto,  2021).  Given  the  increasing  pressure  governments  face  to  increase  cost  efficiency,  they\\n\\nmay transfer waste disposal services to private firms  (Jacobsen et  al. ,  2013). This  possibility has raised the dilemma of whether for-profit enterprises are compatible with outcomes that maximise social welfare (Kinnaman, 2009); the available findings are mixed (Bel and Fageda, 2010; Sim\\u00f5es et al. , 2012).\\n\\nEmpirical evidence based on the existing MSW management business models is important, as it shows how economic and political factors exert different impacts on MSW management via both private  and  public  firms  (Plata-D\\u00edaz et  al. , 2014).  Other  studies  indicate  that  private  MSW management operators are not necessarily better performers than public firms (Bel and Fageda, 2010).\\n\\nAdditionally,  firm  size,  inter-firm  relations,  and  alternative  technologies,  as  found  in  studies  on green  reverse  logistics  technology  (Mugoni  et  al.,  2023),  can  be  argued  to  significantly  impact MSW management strategies (Lombrano, 2009). Considering that the size of firms that perform public services may correspond to a greater propensity to innovate, it is intuitive that advancing MSW business models can improve the net economic benefit they provide  (Marashlian and ElFadel,  2005).  Broadly  speaking,  business  models  and  MSW  management  methods,  such  as  the organisation of collection services, have received limited attention (Guerrini et al. , 2017).\\n\\nThese methods are crucial because they significantly impact the organisation of work (Allesch and Brunner,  2014),  and  both  controllable  and  noncontrollable  factors  can  significantly  impact  the costs of MSW management (De Jaeger and Rogge, 2013).\\n\\nFurthermore,  the  way  the  service  is  provided,  and  the  size  and  density  of  the  population  also affect  the  costs  of  MSW  management  due  to  economies  of  scale  (De  Jaeger et  al. ,  2011).  The characteristics of the waste produced also play an important role (Chifari et al. , 2017; Greco et al. , 2015). Worth remembering is that morphological and geographical factors (Passarini et al. , 2011), socioeconomic conditions (Mazzanti et al. , 2008), and policies and legal frameworks (Benito-L\\u00f3pez et al. , 2011) are also central to forming cost structures. Environmental objectives (Beccarello and Di Foggia, 2016), production technologies (Swart and Groot, 2015; Tisserant et al. , 2017), and the use of waste management facilities (Chu et al. , 2019) also play a role in this process.\\n\\nWith  respect  to  how  the  competitive  environment  and  business  strategies  influence  agility, adaptability, and alignment -which are linked, as reported by a recent study (Garrido-Vega et al. , 2021) -there  is  a  paucity  of  articles  focusing  on  the  strategic  behaviour  of  MSW  management firms. Some  studies  have  drawn  conclusions  concerning  the  degree  and  type  of  market competition (Bel and Seb\\u0151, 2020, 2021) .\\n\\n\\n## 3. Methodology\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3.1 Context\\n\\n\\nThe  waste  management  industry  is  a  hybrid,  regulated,  and  market-driven  sector  as  the  main activities  in  the  collection  phase  are  often  allocated  to  legal  monopolies,  whereas  those  in  the treatment phase, for example of waste electrical and electronic equipment (Roy et al., 2022), can mostly be fulfilled by the market.\\n\\nTherefore, analysing  economic  and  environmental  efficiency  based  on  identifying  economies  of scale  and  scope  is  particularly  complicated.  As  evidence  of  this,  the  results  in  the  previous literature do not necessarily reach the same conclusions. There are many reasons for this. Studies have  been  conducted  in  different  disciplines;  also,  the  type  of  cost  analysed  as  a  dependent variable  (e.g.  total  costs,  costs  of  separated  collection,  costs  of  nonsegregated  collection,  sales prices) differs depending on the context. The unit of analysis may contribute to the variance in the results, and the analysed phase plays a large role in this phenomenon.\\n\\nWe  refer  to  the  combination  of  the  transaction  cost  approach,  economies  of  scale,  and  the competitive  aspects  that are becoming  increasingly  important  in  defining  how  the  MSW management industry should function.\\n\\nThe idea of transaction costs is applied in many contexts, from simple situations to more general ideas that consider various methods for allocating resources and coordinating economic activity (Klaes, 2016). Transaction costs are a necessary first step in separating the factor market from the product  market.  It  may  be  impossible  to  distinguish  between  markets  in  service  industries characterised by a supply chain with a significant number of suppliers. Therefore, distinguishing one  organisation  from  another  is  often  difficult  when  decisions  are  contractually  binding. Furthermore,  transaction  costs  are  often  difficult  to  measure  and  separate  by  type  (Cheung, 2016).\\n\\nTransaction  costs,  like  production  costs,  are  a  wide-ranging  designation  for  a  heterogeneous assortment of inputs and transaction functions that may show diminishing, constant, or increasing returns;  in  general,  economies  of  scale  are  often  pronounced.  Compared  to  a  theoretical  state without  transaction  costs,  transaction  costs  inevitably  reduce  social  welfare  due  to  the  loss  of allocative  efficiency  they  incur.  Efficiency  problems  also  arise  in  a  more  general  context.  As complicated transactions may include multilateral contracts with many parties, transaction costs tend to increase (Niehans, 2016).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nFigure 1 is a theoretical approximation of how transaction costs can be delineated within the twostage  waste  chain.  Figure  1a  represents  an  integrated  provider  operating  at  both  levels  of  the supply chain. Figure 1b represents a market structure characterised by several firms that, as in the case  of  an  integrated  system,  operate  in  several  stages  of  the  supply  chain.  In  this  case,  the concessionaire must manage contracts with some firms, which, as it is a public service, must be provided at the same level of quality for all citizens. Figure 1c represents a market structure in which multiple firms specialise in services that take place in only one phase of the supply chain. In this  case,  a  similar  situation  to  that  described  in  Figure  1b  arises;  however,  not  only  is  a coordination point necessary at a horizontal level in the same phase of the supply chain but also\\n\\nan additional element is added consisting of the provision of a service in only one phase of the supply chain. Figure 1d generalises different configurations. Please note that the cases presented in Figure 1 do not include all possible configurations.\\n\\nThe phases that make up this network industry as well as the main functions -and consequently the different services within the two resulting phases -can be seen in Figure 2.\\n\\nFigure 2. Waste management chain\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nFigure 2 shows operations in one or more phases. Figure 2 also includes an additional phase (the generation  of  urban  waste),  as  it  is  increasingly  important  in  organising  citizen  activities  that extend beyond mere communication and awareness campaigns. The two arrows are significant. The arrow in the upper part of Figure 2 shows the path of waste; that in the lower part reflects the circular economic process.\\n\\nTherefore, the relationship between efficiency and economies of scale is more important at both policy  and  market  organisation  levels,  and  thus,  the  number  of  relevant  studies  on  the  cost  of MSW management  has  increased  (P\\u00e9rez-L\\u00f3pez et  al. ,  2016;  Sarra et  al. ,  2017).  The  economic literature has often focused on the determinants of demand for MSW management services (DiazFarina et  al. ,  2020),  organisational  forms  and  mode  of  supply  (Zhang et  al. ,  2015),  and  cost structures of MSW management (Callan and Thomas, 2001; P\\u00e9rez-L\\u00f3pez et al. , 2016) as well as the need to develop MSW management strategies to achieve sustainability goals.\\n\\n\\n## 3.2 Research design\\n\\n\\nThe analyses were developed at two levels to increase the robustness of the results; two research questions were developed to investigate this topic.\\n\\nRQ1: What is the relation between the size of the service and the cost? An econometric analysis based on 54% of Italian municipalities was developed to identify the impact of the determinants of MSW  management  costs.  Then,  a  sensitivity  analysis  of  different  samples  was  performed  by dividing the sample into 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 subsamples. The hypothesis is an inverse relationship between scale and cost.\\n\\nRQ2: Which factors impact the optimisation of MSW management services? A case study was used to test the best option between assigning MSW management to a single firm or dividing the city into four lots and assigning the service to four firms. The observed cost was reclassified, based on the 56 subservices (see Annex 1 for additional details) that constitute the service. An alternative scenario in which four firms provide MSW management services was simulated for comparative purposes.\\n\\nThis scenario first considered the organisational structure of the incumbent, which is divided into four branches referring to four subareas of the city of Milan. Then, a hypothetical total cost was calculated, based on the four existing operating divisions. The case study analysis aimed to shed light  on  the  operating  and  organisational  factors  that  have  received  little  attention  thus  far  in MSW  research  on  scale  and  scope.  The  hypothesis  is  that  a  single  contractor  is  expected  to provide MSW management services more efficiently due to organisational issues and transaction costs.\\n\\n\\n## 3.3 Data collection and variables\\n\\n\\nThe official data from the municipal waste cadastre published by the Italian national environmental protection institute (ISPRA) and openly accessible from the ISPRA web portal were used  to  run  the  analyses.  The  cadastre  database  contains  data  referring  to  the  cost  of  MSW management,  treatment  options,  and  waste  production  at  the  municipality  level.  Similarly,  the data available in the public balance sheets of the city of Milan were used. Only municipalities with available  data  were  included  in  the  sample.  The  morphological  and  geographical  data  were retrieved  from  the  Italian  Statistics  Institute  portal,  which  contains  the  data  on  all  Italian municipalities, which are publicly available for download. We aimed to increase the robustness of the  analysis  at  the  subsample  level  by  rerunning  the  econometric  analysis  using  comparable municipalities by size, as reported in the sensitivity analysis.\\n\\nTable I contains the key statistics for the variables used in this analysis. The data refer to 2019, as it was the last available certified period at the time of data collection.\\n\\nTable I: Variables\\n\\nFigure 3. Correlation between the main variables and their relative distribution\\n\\nNote. Correlation matrix, scatter plot, and density of the main variables used in this analysis.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n\\n## 4. Empirical Evidence\\n\\n\\nFigure  4  shows  the  relationship  between  costs  and  the  scale  of  services.  As  this  relationship  is influenced by organisational dynamics, the scale of services and costs appear inversely related.\\n\\nFigure 4. Scale and costs of MSW management\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n\\n## 4.1 Econometric analysis\\n\\n\\nApplying the model in Equation (1) and shown in Table 2, the determinants of  the variations in MSW management costs  with  respect  to  organisational  size  were  examined.  Other  conditions, such  as  the  specific  demographic  and  morphological  characteristics  of  the  territory  (which, together with the industrial structure of the waste treatment phase, influence MSW management costs), were considered. Furthermore, whether the average cost of MSW management tends to decrease as the population increases was checked. In Equation 1, the dependent variable is the average  cost  of  management  (Eurocents  per  kg),  while  the  independent  variables  are  the population, size of the area in which the service is provided, percentage of separated collection, population density, and altitude, as well as being a coastal municipality or otherwise.\\n\\nEquation 1: Econometric analysis\\n\\nThe equation is reiterated in three variants, as shown in Table II, which contains three columns corresponding to the three models, specifically:\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Model 1 refers to the total cost of the MSW management service;\\n- \\u00b7 Model 2 refers to the management costs of sorted waste;\\n- \\u00b7 Model 3 refers to the management costs of residual waste.\\n\\nRegarding  Model  1,  Figure  5  shows  the  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  performed  to  test  the robustness of the results.\\n\\nTable II: Econometric analysis\\n\\nConsidering the results shown in Table III, it appears that an inverse relation between the scale of the service and the cost exists in the types of costs considered when developing the three models.\\n\\nFigure 5. Average cost reduction due to scale\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nNote: see Annex 2 for additional details.\\n\\nFigure 5 presents a sensitivity analysis of the elasticity of the average cost of production in terms of the amount of waste handled, which seems to confirm the general hypothesis that asserts that the  MSW  sector  tends  to  be  characterised  by  economies  of  scale.  The  coefficient  for  the  full population  was -0.46.  As  the  number  of  intervals  increases,  the  coefficient,  although  based  on limited data, tends to increase. At this point, we conduct a comparative evaluation of the cost of collection and transport of the main Italian cities, which represents the segment of urban MSW management  most  affected  by  the  dynamics  of  company  organisation  and  the  consequent optimisation of services. Such an analysis allows a comparative assessment based on a scenario defined by subdividing the city of Milan into four subareas to simulate the organisation of MSW management services and examine the impact of transaction costs.\\n\\nGiven that the analysis is limited to the main Italian cities and a small number of observations, we proceed with a bottom-up approach that reconstructs the costs using information published on\\n\\nthe  website  of  the  Municipality  of  Milan,  including  the  2019  financial  statements  of  the incumbent,  explanatory  notes,  and  the  service  contract  between  the  Municipality  and  the incumbent. The scenario in which four firms provide MSW management services would imply a 6% increase in production costs compared to that of the incumbent.\\n\\n\\n## 5. Discussion\\n\\n\\nEconomies of scale can play a significant role in defining business models even though they may seemingly  conflict  with  the  common  knowledge  that  policymakers  should  favour  SMEs  in  the provision of public services to create new opportunities and support the growth of SMEs, which in turn can make a significant economic contribution. It is worth emphasising that the involvement of SMEs  in  public  procurement  allows  contracting  authorities  to  broaden  their  base  of  potential suppliers  and  to  benefit  from  the  increased  competition  for  public  contracts.  However,  such positive  externalities  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  market  development  gains  vanish  in  certain circumstances. Indeed, the arguments regarding the presence of economies shall be contextualised to fit with the cases. Considering that a few studies have stated that the existence of scale economies, to a certain level, does not indicate that it can be generalised to all cities. In fact,  most  studies  have  analysed  samples  only  with  no  or  just  a  few  large  municipalities.  In contrast,  this  article  deeply  analyses  the  MSW  cost  structure  in  a  1.38-million  inhabited  city, suggesting that the MSW service is large and complex enough to require specific analyses.\\n\\nIn cities where public or private incumbent monopolies have long-run MSW management services, policymakers should not allow for excessive exemptions, such as splitting a city's area into several subareas to allow more firms to participate in MSW management. Nevertheless, it is possible to argue that splitting the municipal area into several subareas or the MSW management service into subservices  each,  or  some  of  them  corresponding  to  many,  may  encourage  anti-competitive strategies. This action limits the number of lots in which a single economic operator can run the service  and  may  even  lead  to  covert  agreements  between  competitors,  which  would  in  turn worsen social welfare, for example, due to transaction costs (Cheung, 2016; DaSilva and Trkman, 2014) that have received little attention in MSW management studies.\\n\\nAnalysing the city of Milan enabled the determination of the efficiency of the business model by including  costs  sourced  from  public  information  regarding  the  incumbent,  and  the  results conveyed  that  a  single  firm  was  more  efficient  than  four  firms.  The  main  reasons  highlighted include  the  differences,  especially  regarding  the  separated  collection  of  materials  (e.g.  streetsweeping  activities  and  bin-emptying  activities),  given  that  the  production  factors,  employees, means of production, and containers required are proportional in the two scenarios analysed in this article. However, this study found several issues related to transaction costs. Furthermore, the results indicate that the incumbent is more efficient from an economic standpoint.\\n\\nThe services causing the greatest cost burden are those related to collection, which include the sorting  of  bulky  waste,  durables,  batteries,  pharmaceuticals,  and  spent  toner  cartridges,  the collection of residual and differentiated waste with dedicated containers, the collection of residual and  differentiated  waste  in  cemeteries,  the  cleaning  of  markets,  the  collection  and  disposal  of small  items  containing  asbestos,  the  separated  collection  of  used  clothing,  the  separated collection of used oil, and some sweeping activities such as cleaning the banks of watercourses, collecting  leaves,  cleaning  tree  rows  and  their  areas,  mowing  and  weeding  pavements,  and washing tunnels, arcades, and subways. Similarly, other activities, including on-demand services, have been shown to experience a significant increase in costs. Some production factors are not divisible or shareable between firms, which would entail the duplication of that production factor and therefore its cost.\\n\\nEvidence suggests that entrusting MSW management services to a single firm may positively affect the community given the potential cost savings (-6%) and, thereby, the waste tax that citizens pay to  finance  them.  The  main  drivers  increasing  production  costs  are  the  need  for  personnel  and means of production -namely, vehicles -to provide the same level of service if they were to be provided  by  several  firms.  The  above  results  are  correlated  with  strategic  management  and uncertainty-coping strategies, given that uncertainty plays a substantial role in strategic decisionmaking processes and increases the risk and ambiguity of innovation (Beraha et al. , 2018), which is needed to improve the performance of the MSW management industry.\\n\\nInterestingly, a recent study focusing on the city of Barcelona showed that dividing the region into four  lots  discriminated  in  terms  of  quality  and,  furthermore,  differentiated  service  quality.  The study  analysed  the  effects  of  competition  by  focusing  on  the  strategic  behaviour  of  firms  and illustrated  the  incentive  to  strategically  determine  the  quality,  based  on  the  operating  distance from competitors, which is an approximation of competitive pressure. This is, therefore, a risk if the principle of universality of service quality is to be respected. It is important to avoid triggering strategic behaviours  that  increase service quality only in the most  relevant  and  directly comparable areas (Bel and Seb\\u0151, 2021).\\n\\nHowever, both positive and negative aspects  should  be noted  to exist even when  a  single  firm provides the service, as shown in Table III.\\n\\nTable III. Alternative scenarios Table III. Opportunities of alternative scenarios\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Reduction  of  transaction  costs  resulting from fewer contracts;\\n- \\u00b7 Equity  and  same  quality  of  the  service provided to citizens.\\n- \\u00b7 Technological innovation given that positive linkages between size and innovation can occur in presence of high sunk costs.\\n- \\u00b7 Quality standardization that derives from the same organization of inputs.\\n- \\u00b7 More symmetric information and performance comparison among competitors\\n- \\u00b7 Low  market  concentration  that  if  not properly regulated may lead to inefficiency  in  the  medium-term  due  to the loss of market attractivity for potential efficient firms.\\n- \\u00b7 Reduced risks of market foreclosure.\\n- \\u00b7 level playing field.\\n- \\u00b7 Economies  of scale especially in the collection phase.\\n\\nThe results also provide information on the compatibility of such strategic behaviour of firms with the principle of universality of service. This is an essential element and a principle that cannot be derogated from and a risk that may emerge. A further risk lies in the information asymmetries between  local  authorities  and  contractors,  which  could  reduce  the  efforts  of  the  latter  in neighbourhoods farthest from those where there is more competition.\\n\\nThe main contribution of this paper is threefold. From a theoretical perspective, it summarises the previous literature on economies of scale and scope in MSW management and provides thoughtprovoking results that further the discussion on competitive policy and the regulation of public services. From a managerial perspective, the results offer new insights into critical organisational and operating factors that may emerge in running such services, which, due to transaction and other costs, may lead to suboptimal levels of output and economic inefficiency. This paper also has policy  implications  given  that  the  abovementioned  considerations  can  serve  as  a  reference  for public decision-makers in designing municipal strategies that consider economic and social welfare outcomes. Managerial and practical perspectives are also straightforward for both bit utilities and SMEs, which shall analyse in detail the organisational and transaction costs they may experience in running this service in complex circumstances.\\n\\nOur results also suggest that additional research is needed to evaluate the relation between scale and MSW management costs, which is a public service of general interest. Its effectiveness should be evaluated from a contracting authority -often municipality -perspective, not only from the firm perspective, paying more attention to the exogenous factors affecting the organisation of the\\n\\nservice.  Indeed,  failing  to  consider  the  above  may  result  in  formally  correct  results  but  bias  in practice  if  the  subadditivity  of  costs  is  not  considered.  In  fact,  a  paradox  may  emerge.  When analysing samples of firms the results of relatively small-scale economies may suggest the optimal size  that,  if  put  into  practice  in  relatively  large  cities,  resulted  in  multiple  firms  operating conjunctively, paving the way to transition costs and organisational failures that lead to negative externalities: one pitfall relates to costs, and the other downside refers to different quality levels that may occur in different parts of the cities because the service is run by different companies, and  other  hypothetical  problems  emerge  in  the  potential  strategic  behaviour  of  firms  and difficulties in regulating more firm issues.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n\\nThis  paper  investigates  the  scale  and  scope  of  MSW  management  business  models  in  terms  of their economic efficiency to provide empirical evidence to support both the debate and the design of competitive waste management policy strategies. On one hand, it is generally recognised that the broad participation of SMEs in the provision of public services is a public policy goal. On the other hand, monopolistic competition outperforms other models in certain circumstances -for example,  in  that  of  integrated  utilities,  which  can  provide  more  services  at  more  stages  of  the supply  chain,  owing  to  economies  of  scale  and  scope  resulting  from  their  optimised  and streamlined production models.\\n\\nA novel contribution of this paper is in its effort to analyse and test the same hypothesis across different conditions. From a national perspective, based on an econometric analysis of a significant sample of Italian municipalities, the results confirm the presence of an inverse relation between the scale and the average cost of the service. This finding is important considering that as the size of the service increases by 1%, the average cost of MSW management services decreases by 0.46% nationwide.  From  the  results,  the  inverse  relation  between  service  scale  and  costs  can  also  be inferred to persist even under different hypotheses, as confirmed by our scenario analysis.\\n\\nTo fine-tune the analysis and provide useful insights that benefit managers and local administrators,  a  simulation  has  been  carried  out  for  the  city  of  Milan  by  testing  whether  the service costs were lower when run by a single firm compared to when run by four different firms. The evidence suggests that MSW management is more efficient when carried out by a single firm given the industry structure, resource and labour force optimisation, and lower transaction costs, which,  in  certain  circumstances,  overcome  the  efficiency  gains  of  the  market,  envisaged  by economic theory.\\n\\nThe  simulation  revealed  that  dividing  the  city  into  subareas  may  lead  to  diseconomies,  thus undermining economic efficiency and general service quality and creating undesirable consequences for social welfare and the equal treatment of citizens. Therefore, there are  cases where contracting authorities shall decide that it is not appropriate to divide the contract into lots\\n\\ndue  to  the  risk  of  rendering  the  execution  of  the  contract  excessively  technically  difficult  or expensive and because coordinating the different contractors could risk undermining the proper execution of the contract to the detriment of equity and quality.\\n\\nThis  study  has  certain  limitations.  The  results  are  extendable  and  relevant  to  other  cities  only when the spatial and socioeconomic characteristics are comparable given that the factors used to identify whether a single firm is more efficient can lead to varied results in cities characterised by nonhomogeneous conditions or in larger multicentric cities. In fact, the land of the city of Milan is flat,  with  an  altitude  of  approximately  130  metres,  on  an  administrative  area  of  approximately 181.7  square  kilometres,  with  a  population  of  slightly  less  than  1.4  million  inhabitants:  7,315 inhabitants  per  square  kilometre.  Consequently,  a  very  different  situation  with  respect,  for example, to Rome: approximately 2,860,889 residents in 1,285 km 2 , 2.226 inhabitants per square kilometre, and varied land characteristics. In such urban conditions, the results in terms of optimal business  organisation  may  significantly  change,  preventing  our  results  from  being  extended  to geographically significantly different cities.\\n\\nIn  the  context  of  large  cities,  both  the  advantages  of  dividing  the  municipal  area  into  smaller subareas -or the service into more lots -to facilitate the potential entry of smaller operators and the a priori advantages related to the existence of economies of scale need to be further studied and contextualised to avoid a strategic drift in municipal waste service planning.\\n\\nThe  future  research  should  focus  on  two  topics.  First,  the  activities  that  comprise  waste management services should be broken down to investigate the opportunities presented by and costs  of  alternative  forms  of  management  for  each  subservice  according  to  scale  and  other exogenous factors. Second, provided that cross-sectional studies struggle due to sampling reasons, an analysis of the impact of economies of scale and scope in large cities is needed using case study approaches.\\n\\n\",\n          \"## Background\\n\\n\\nSocio-economic inequalities in common mental disorders (CMDs) such as lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation, and perceived treatment helpfulness have been documented in various settings. However, whether these inequalities are present globally (in both HICs and LMICs) and what factors explain between-country variation is unclear because of inadequate cross-national data. We therefore examine this question using a recently published global, individual-level survey data.\\n\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n\\nThis study uses a nationally representative individual-level survey dataset (Wellcome Global Monitor 2020), in 111 countries (N= 117,088) to test if socio-economic factors (household income quintile, education), psycho-social factors (local stigma perception, trust in health professionals) and country-level factors (GDP, Gini, health expenditure) predict (1) CMD lifetime prevalence, (2) utilisation and (3) perceived helpfulness of talking to a mental health professional and taking prescribed medication. Multi-level logistic regression models were used.\\n\\n\\n## Findings\\n\\n\\nAcross both HICs and LMICs, individuals in higher household quintiles are less likely to experience anxiety or depression (OR=0.90 for each increase in income quintile, 95% CI[0.89-0.91]), more likely to talk to a mental health professional (OR=1.05[1.03-1.07]) and more likely to perceive this treatment as 'very helpful' (OR=1.06[1.03-1.09]). Income is not, however, linked to utilisation (OR=0.98[0.97-1.01]) and helpfulness of taking prescribed medication (OR=1.02[0.99-1.05]). Perceived stigma reduces mental health professional utilisation (OR=0.93[0.90-0.97]) and helpfulness (OR=0.76[0.72-0.81]), while trust in health practitioners increases both utilisation (OR=1.10[1.06-1.14]) and helpfulness (OR=1.32[1.24-1.40]). Country-level health expenditure is related to higher mental health professional utilisation (OR=1.11[1.04-1.19].\\n\\n\\n## Interpretation\\n\\n\\nThis analysis reveals a global 'triple inequality effect', whereby the disadvantages of lower SES individuals persist in each outcome (lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and helpfulness). But these inequalities are moderated by background factors such as stigma and trust in health\\n\\nprofessionals, and depend on the type of treatment. These findings suggest that addressing inequalities in CMDs cannot focus on only one of these inequalities alone nor can efforts ignore the social context in which they are embedded.\\n\\n\\n## 1. Research in Context\\n\\n\\n\\n## Evidence before this study\\n\\n\\nWe conducted searches in Google Scholar and PubMed for publications up to February 2023 on papers coving cross-national work on social inequalities in mental health. We used the terms such as 'global inequalities in mental health', 'socio-economic status and mental health',  'global mental health survey', 'mental health treatment gap', 'inequalities in mental health treatment utilisation', 'perceived treatment helpfulness for depression'. Our search finds a strong, crossnational evidence base on CMD prevalence based on the Global Burden of Disease studies. Further, we found a variety of studies based on the WHO World Mental Health surveys and the Eurobarometer surveys 2006 and 2010 that find evidence for within-country socio-economic inequalities in treatment utilisation. One study found evidence that education is linked to perceived treatment helpfulness. Research frequently identified stigma as a barrier for CMD treatment utilisation. However, the studies on treatment utilisation and treatment helpfulness are limited to datasets that cover less than 30 countries. So far, the biggest cross-national survey datasets on treatment utilisation are based on the EU's Eurobarometer surveys. Therefore, between-country variation and predictors as well as differences between LMICs and HICs could not be thoroughly examined. Further, we did not find any cross-national study that investigates social inequalities of different mental health outcomes (e.g., prevalence, treatment utilisation, and helpfulness) together in one study to identify how social inequalities deepen across different health outcomes.\\n\\n\\n## Added Value of this study\\n\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a new, global survey dataset that covers 111 countries (both LMICs and HICs) to investigate socio-economic and psycho-social inequalities in three different CMD health outcomes. It is also the first study covering a sufficient number of countries to investigate country-level predictors of treatment utilisation and helpfulness. Our analysis uncovers a global 'triple inequality effect' in CMD prevalence, treatment utilisation and perceived treatment helpfulness in both LMICs and HICs, whereby disadvantages for lower SES individuals persist and deepen at each health outcome. This effect is moderated by psychological and country-level factors: Our study is the first one to show that trust in health practitioners is highly associated with both treatment utilization and treatment helpfulness. Finally, we discovered a notable exception to the 'triple inequality effect' as it does not persist for pharmacological treatment: In LMICs, more affluent individuals were less likely to take prescribed medication when affected by anxiety or depression.\\n\\n\\n## Implications of all the available evidence\\n\\n\\nOur findings suggest that efforts to reduce mental health inequalities need to account for how socio-economic factors simultaneously influence a variety of related health outcomes and consider the social context in which such efforts are embedded. For the design of policies and scaling up mental healthcare, policy makers and health practitioners need to focus on social inequalities in several different health outcomes throughout the cascade of care. This study also points to the need to consider the root causes of social inequality to improve multiple health outcomes at the same time. Finally, this study shows that psycho-social factors such as stigma and\\n\\ntrust in health professionals not only determine treatment uptake, but also to the perceived benefit of treatment.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Introduction\\n\\n\\nCommon mental disorders (CMDs), which include depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders, are a primary cause of global disease burden  . 1\\n\\nNotably, CMDs are socially stratified. This becomes clear in the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and three related health outcomes: Individuals with lower SES (1) have a higher lifetime prevalence of CMDs, (2) are less likely to utilise professional treatment (3) are less likely to perceive treatment as helpful when they do receive it 2-4 . This sequence of socioeconomic inequalities suggests that inequalities deepen as individuals move from being affected to experiencing treatment outcomes. Besides socio-economic inequalities, psychosocial factors (e.g., stigma and attitudes) and country-level factors (e.g., economic conditions and healthcare spending) may play a role to determine who receives and who benefits from treatment 2,5 . While we have some evidence documenting these associations across countries, most of this work has been carried out almost entirely in high income countries 6,7 . Therefore, we do not know if socio-economic and psycho-social patterns in lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and perceived helpfulness exist universally, and what factors explain betweencountry variations. This study addresses this gap by investigating what socio-economic, psycho-social and country-level factors are correlated with these three health outcomes in a global survey across 111 countries.\\n\\n\\n## Socio-economic factors\\n\\n\\nOut of the different health outcomes in this study, the link between SES (income and education) and CMD lifetime prevalence the most thoroughly documented across country contexts as lower SES individuals are more frequently affected by depression and anxiety  . 8 Theories on the pathway between income and mental health identify material circumstances, psycho-social stress, and behavioural differences  . SES also affects treatment utilisation for 4\\n\\nCMDs  3 . Generally, only a minority of affected individuals receives minimally adequate treatment  . Evidence from the European Union and Switzerland suggests that those 9 individuals who do utilise treatment have higher educational attainment and income 5,10 . Lastly, SES is associated with treatment effectiveness. Two systematic reviews using studies from the US and Europe showed that the effectiveness of psychological therapies 11 and antidepressant treatments 12 is lower for low SES individuals. As an explanation, lower SES individuals might face more socio-economic stressors which cannot be relieved by treatment 13 . Besides treatment effectiveness, perceived helpfulness is as a patient-centred way to measure treatment outcomes 14 , that yields high levels of external validity (Edlund et al., 2015). Using data from WHO's World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative across 16 countries, researchers found that individuals with higher education perceive depression treatment as more helpful  . In summary, we do not know if the association between SES and mental health 2 outcomes is stable across all country contexts. We hypothesise that SES is associated with lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and helpfulness in both HICs and LMICs (H1).\\n\\n\\n## Psycho-social factors\\n\\n\\nMental health stigma and negative help-seeking attitudes are well-documented barriers for utilising CMD treatment and explain part of the relationship between SES and treatment utilisation 16 . Stigma is a particularly widely studied barrier to treatment-seeking, with crossnational evidence stemming from the 2006 and 2010 Eurobarometer surveys  . Other psycho7 social factors gained less attention. Qualitative evidence suggests that trust in mental health practitioners and services is an important determinant of help-seeking 17,18 . However, trust has not been examined in quantitative, cross-national studies. Psycho-social factors might also be associated with the abovementioned measure of perceived helpfulness. The implications of outcome expectations and associated placebo effects for pharmacological treatments and talking therapy are well documented 19 . However, whether stigma or trust in health\\n\\npractitioners are correlated with perceived treatment helpfulness has not been investigated across countries. Again, cross-national evidence on treatment utilisation and helpfulness is limited to European countries, and the role of trust is under-researched. We hypothesise that stigma and trust in healthcare professionals are associated with treatment utilisation and helpfulness across a sample of 111 countries (H2).\\n\\n\\n## Country-level factors\\n\\n\\nLifetime prevalence of CMDs varies across country contexts. The Global Burden of Diseases study shows that HICs tend to have a lower prevalence than LMICs  . Regarding treatment 1 utilisation, the size of mental health treatment gaps varies depending on country-level economic and healthcare capabilities. The WMH Survey Initiative shows that 36% of people affected by anxiety disorders utilise treatment in HICs, and only 13% in lower-middle-income countries 20 . Evidence on country-level variations in healthcare utilisation is based on the Eurobarometer surveys 2006 and 2010. In Europe, healthcare spending and the available mental healthcare workforce explain cross-national variation in antidepressant use  . 5\\n\\nCountry-level variation in treatment helpfulness is not well-documented. The only two studies on this topic using the WMH Survey Initiative involved too few countries to include specific country-level predictors 2,21 . Surprisingly, patients in LMICs reported a higher treatment helpfulness for antidepressants than in HICs 21 . However, it is unclear if national-level differences in healthcare spending or quality-of-care influence treatment helpfulness. We hypothesise that GDP, health expenditure and lower out-of-pocket health expenditure are associated with higher treatment utilisation and helpfulness (H3).\\n\\n\\n## Study rationale and hypotheses\\n\\n\\nOverall, there is a lack of global cross-national evidence to understand the within and between country variations of three central CMD health outcomes (lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and treatment helpfulness). Using an individual-level survey dataset in 111\\n\\ncountries, we investigate if socio-economic and psycho-social inequalities in the three health outcomes exist universally, and what factors explain between-country variation.\\n\\nThere are two main reasons for studying the three health outcomes together. First, we cannot fully understand the mechanisms behind inequalities in the burden of disease by studying single health outcomes if inequalities exacerbate over different health outcomes. Research on infectious diseases and depression 22,23 used cascades of care approaches to examine at what points of the treatment journey patients drop out. Here, we apply this thinking to CMDs and examine three major health outcomes (who is affected, who receives treatment and who perceives treatment as helpful), while our interest is in understanding inequalities at each step. Notably, we focus three key health outcomes in many countries, instead of a larger healthcare cascade in one specific context. Second, differences in the determinants of the three health outcomes might have differential implications on what policies are needed to reduce health inequalities. Studying the outcomes together in one study can make such differences explicit.\\n\\n\\n## Hypotheses\\n\\n\\nIn summary, existing work in this area suggests 3 hypotheses relevant to our main research objective.\\n\\nH1(SES). Lower SES individuals have a higher CMD lifetime prevalence, are less likely to utilise professional treatment and to perceive this treatment as helpful, irrespective of HIC/LMIC country context.\\n\\nH2(Psycho-social) . Lower levels of stigma perceptions and higher levels of trust in health practitioners is associated with higher treatment utilisation and perceived helpfulness. H3(Country-level/Macroeconomic). Higher GDP and health expenditure, and lower out-of- pocket health expenditure are associated with higher treatment utilisation and helpfulness.\\n\\n\\n## 3. Methods\\n\\n\\n\\n## Sample\\n\\n\\nThe data was collected via telephone between August 2020 and January 2021 by Gallup commissioned by the Wellcome Trust. The dataset is publicly available online, alongside research and methodology reports 24 . The dataset included representative population-based surveys in 113 countries. Two countries were exluced because in Tajikistan, the mental health items were not included and in Venezuala, the variable on participants' household income is missing which is central to estimate socio-economic inequalties. Therefore, the final sample included 111 counties and 117,088 participants (see supplamentary Table S9). Data collection was situated in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Survey development was concluded before the pandemic and data collection had started before being interrupted in March 2020. Yet, the conclusions of this study aim to be relevant beyond the pandemic's context: All outcome variables used in this study refer to lifetime experiences rather than pandemic-related events.\\n\\nVariables\\n\\n\\n## Dependent variables\\n\\n\\nLifetime prevalence of anxiety or depression was measured using a single item 'Have you ever been so anxious or depressed that you could not continue your regular daily activities as you normally would for two weeks or longer' with 'Yes' or 'No'  The item was designed by . Wellcome Trust researchers considering the general diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression with the goal to elicit analytical comparisons across country-contexts and cultures (rather than epidemiological precision of prevalence) 24 . The item underwent cognitive testing to fulfil this purpose of cross-country comparability. Respondents who reported lifetime experience with anxiety or depression were asked about two types of treatment utilisation: 'When you were feeling so anxious or depressed, did you ever do any of the following to\\n\\nmake yourself feel better? Talk to a mental health professional' and 'Take medication prescribed by a healthcare professional' ('Yes' / 'No'). Both items underwent cognitive testing in 10 countries to confirm interpretability across countries. This showed that 'talking to a mental health professional' was interpreted by the participants in a variety of ways such as 'talking to a therapist, doing talk therapy, or talking to a mental health professional' . Similarly, for 'taking prescribed medication', the type of medication was intentionally left open.\\n\\nThose who answered treatment utilisation questions with 'Yes' were questioned on their perceived treatment helpfulness \\\"Did you find the following very helpful, somewhat helpful, or not helpful in making you feel better?' regarding both treatment types (3= Very helpful , 2= Somewhat helpful , 1= not helpful ). To ensure consistency of interpretation and effect sizes across all statistical models (see Figure 1 and Table 2), categorised ' not helpful ' and ' somewhat helpful ' together as ' not entirely helpful ' (contrasted with the category ' very helpful '). Sensitivity tests showed that results remained stable compared to the original coding (see supplementary Table S8).\\n\\n\\n## Socio-economic factors\\n\\n\\nOut of the different health outcomes in this study, the link between SES (income and education) and CMD lifetime prevalence the most thoroughly documented across country contexts as lower SES individuals are more frequently affected by depression and anxiety  . 8 Theories on the pathway between income and mental health identify material circumstances, psycho-social stress, and behavioural differences  . SES also affects treatment utilisation for 4\\n\\nCMDs  3 . Generally, only a minority of affected individuals receives minimally adequate treatment  . Evidence from the European Union and Switzerland suggests that those 9 individuals who do utilise treatment have higher educational attainment and income 5,10 . Lastly, SES is associated with treatment effectiveness. Two systematic reviews using studies from the US and Europe showed that the effectiveness of psychological therapies 11 and antidepressant treatments 12 is lower for low SES individuals. As an explanation, lower SES individuals might face more socio-economic stressors which cannot be relieved by treatment 13 . Besides treatment effectiveness, perceived helpfulness is as a patient-centred way to measure treatment outcomes 14 , that yields high levels of external validity (Edlund et al., 2015). Using data from WHO's World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative across 16 countries, researchers found that individuals with higher education perceive depression treatment as more helpful  . In summary, we do not know if the association between SES and mental health 2 outcomes is stable across all country contexts. We hypothesise that SES is associated with lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and helpfulness in both HICs and LMICs (H1).\\n\\n\\n## Psycho-social factors\\n\\n\\nMental health stigma and negative help-seeking attitudes are well-documented barriers for utilising CMD treatment and explain part of the relationship between SES and treatment utilisation 16 . Stigma is a particularly widely studied barrier to treatment-seeking, with crossnational evidence stemming from the 2006 and 2010 Eurobarometer surveys  . Other psycho7 social factors gained less attention. Qualitative evidence suggests that trust in mental health practitioners and services is an important determinant of help-seeking 17,18 . However, trust has not been examined in quantitative, cross-national studies. Psycho-social factors might also be associated with the abovementioned measure of perceived helpfulness. The implications of outcome expectations and associated placebo effects for pharmacological treatments and talking therapy are well documented 19 . However, whether stigma or trust in health\\n\\npractitioners are correlated with perceived treatment helpfulness has not been investigated across countries. Again, cross-national evidence on treatment utilisation and helpfulness is limited to European countries, and the role of trust is under-researched. We hypothesise that stigma and trust in healthcare professionals are associated with treatment utilisation and helpfulness across a sample of 111 countries (H2).\\n\\n\\n## Country-level factors\\n\\n\\nLifetime prevalence of CMDs varies across country contexts. The Global Burden of Diseases study shows that HICs tend to have a lower prevalence than LMICs  . Regarding treatment 1 utilisation, the size of mental health treatment gaps varies depending on country-level economic and healthcare capabilities. The WMH Survey Initiative shows that 36% of people affected by anxiety disorders utilise treatment in HICs, and only 13% in lower-middle-income countries 20 . Evidence on country-level variations in healthcare utilisation is based on the Eurobarometer surveys 2006 and 2010. In Europe, healthcare spending and the available mental healthcare workforce explain cross-national variation in antidepressant use  . 5\\n\\nCountry-level variation in treatment helpfulness is not well-documented. The only two studies on this topic using the WMH Survey Initiative involved too few countries to include specific country-level predictors 2,21 . Surprisingly, patients in LMICs reported a higher treatment helpfulness for antidepressants than in HICs 21 . However, it is unclear if national-level differences in healthcare spending or quality-of-care influence treatment helpfulness. We hypothesise that GDP, health expenditure and lower out-of-pocket health expenditure are associated with higher treatment utilisation and helpfulness (H3).\\n\\n\\n## Analyses\\n\\n\\nWe performed multilevel-logistic regression analyses with individuals ( ) nested in countries i ( ) using the R package j lme4 . First, a random intercept model without fixed effects established that the probability of lifetime prevalence and treatment utilisation vary as a function of countries (see Appendix A). Next, fixed effects for both individual and country-level predictors were added to the random intercept model, resulting this following model:\\n\\n## \\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61(\\ud835\\udc38\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc50\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc34\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57)\\n\\n- = \\ud835\\udefe00 +\\ud835\\udefe01 \\u00d7 \\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc56 \\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udefe02 \\u00d7 log(\\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc43) \\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udf070\\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udefe10 \\u00d7\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc50\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5a\\ud835\\udc52 \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57\\n- + \\ud835\\udefe20  \\u00d7 \\ud835\\udc38\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc50\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57 +\\ud835\\udefe30  \\u00d7 \\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udefe40  \\u00d7 \\ud835\\udc34\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57 + \\ud835\\udf00\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc57\\n\\nThis model was adjusted according to the variables in Table 2. For each outcome variable, we condition on the answer \\\"Yes\\\" in the previous question. Therefore, sample sizes of the different regression models vary as shown in Table 2. For the multi-level models, survey weights were applied to yield representative samples within each country. We control for age and gender as important covariates in the mental health literature   and ran several models  to 5 confirm the robustness our results (supplementary Tables S3-S8).\\n\\n\\n## 4. Results\\n\\n\\nFigure 1 summarises descriptive statistics, segregated by HICs and LMICs. Overall, 20.1% of participants reported lifetime experience with anxiety or depression. 8.6% of participants report talking to a mental health professional and 9.6% report taking prescribed medication. The mean helpfulness of both forms of treatment was high ( M= 2.56 for mental health professional utilisation and M= 2.47 for prescribed medication). Most participants rated both treatment types as 'very helpful'.\\n\\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics\\n\\n\\n## Socio-economic factors (H1)\\n\\n\\nH1 states that individual-level SES is associated with higher lifetime prevalence, lower treatment utilisation and lower helpfulness. We used both household income quintile and education as outcomes to test this hypothesis.\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the predicted probability of experiencing anxiety or depression, utilising treatment, and rating this treatment as very helpful as a function of within-country income quintiles (based on simple general linear models). The top three graphs illustrate that higher income levels are associated gradually lower lifetime prevalence, higher mental health professional utilisation and higher perceived helpfulness of talking to a mental health professional in both HICs and LMICs. The lower two graphs show that this social gradient is not found for taking prescribed medication and perceived helpfulness of this treatment. Notably, in LMICs, higher income is associated with a lower likelihood of taking prescribed medication.\\n\\nThe findings are confirmed by the regression models displayed in Table 2. The table contains one statistical model for each dependent variable. A series of further models affirm the robustness of these results (see Tables S3-S8). As shown in Table 2, an increase in one within-country household income quintile is related to a significantly lower probability of experiencing anxiety or depression (OR=0.90; 95% CI[0.89-0.91]), a higher likelihood of mental health professional utilisation (OR=1.05[1.03-1.07]), and a higher likelihood of rating this treatment as very helpful (OR=1.06[1.02-1.09]). In contrast, income is not significantly linked with utilisation (OR=0.98[0.96-1.01]) and perceived helpfulness of taking prescribed medication (OR=1.02[0.99-1.05]). The effects for education follow the same pattern and are displayed in Table 2 and supplementary Figure S3. All results remained stable when using regression models with the 'helpfulness' outcomes on a scale from 1 to 3 (see Table S8).\\n\\nFigure 1. Predicted probabilities of prevalence, treatment utilisation and perceived helfpuless by\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nhousehold income quintiles (95% confidence intervals provided around each predicted value)\\n\\nTable 2 Regression Estimates of Multilevel Logistic Regression on different outcomes (Odds Ratios)\\n\\nNotes . Values reflect unstandardised regression coefficients; * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01. Sample size varies according to the number of people who were asked each survey questions (see methods)\\n\\n\\n## Psycho-social factors (H2)\\n\\n\\nH2, which states that psycho-social factors are associated with treatment utilisation and helpfulness, is confirmed by the results shown in Table 2. Perceived stigma (OR=0.93[0.900.97]), belief in science to treat mental health conditions (OR=1.08[1.05-1.12]) and trust in health professionals (1.10[1.06-1.14]) all predict mental health professional utilisation and also significantly predict the utilisation of prescribed medication in the same direction (see Table 2). Similarly, perceived stigma (OR=0.76[0.72-0.81]) and trust in health professionals (OR=1.32[1.24-1.40]) also predict the perceived helpfulness of both types of treatment in the hypothesised direction. Again, the effects are also stable for the utilisation of medication (see Table 2). Thus, these results did not yield the same differentiation between treatment types as shown for socio-economic factors. The results remained stable when removing the socioeconomic predictors (see Tables S3-S8).\\n\\n\\n## Country-level factors (H3)\\n\\n\\nH3 states that country-level economic and healthcare factors explain between-country variation in the health outcomes. Table 2 highlights several significant country-level effects. Higher income inequality (Gini) is associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety or depression (OR=1.02[1.004-1.03]). GDP (OR=1.26[1.08-1.47]) and health expenditure (OR=1.11[1.04-1.19]) are related to higher mental health professional utilisation. In contrast, for utilisation of prescribed medication, such country level effects were small and not significant. Unexpectedly, higher GDP is related to lower perceived helpfulness of both types of treatment (OR=0.78[0.68-0.91] for mental health professional utilisation and OR=0.81[0.70-0.93] for medication). Country-level out-of-pocket health expenditure was not associated with treatment utilisation and its association with perceived helpfulness of medication (OR=0.99[0.98-0.999] did not (unlike the other abovementioned country-level predictors) remain stable throughout alternative models (see supplementary Tables S3-S7).\\n\\n\\n## 5. Discussion\\n\\n\\nThis study used a survey dataset in 111 countries to investigate within and between country inequalities in the three mental health outcomes of CMD lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and perceived treatment helpfulness.\\n\\nThis study demonstrates that socio-economic inequalities cut across the three health outcomes of prevalence, mental health professional utilization, and perceived helpfulness in both HICs and LMICs. Firstly, in line with previous research individuals with lower SES (income and education) have a higher lifetime prevalence of anxiety and depression 4,8 . Secondly, individuals with higher SES are more likely to talk to a mental health professional when they are affected by anxiety or depression. These results indicate that higher SES individuals are more likely to engage in talking therapy and specialist mental health care. This is in line with Europe-based research on treatment utilisation for mental health services 3,10 and specialist medical healthcare 26 . Thirdly, talking to a mental health professional was perceived as more helpful by higher SES individuals. As potential explanations, talking therapy might be better tailored to the needs of those higher education 27 and might more readily provide perceivable progress for individuals without poverty related pressures 13 . In conclusion, these findings point to a global 'triple inequality effect', whereby disadvantages of lower SES individuals deepen along each of the three health outcomes.\\n\\nHowever, this 'triple inequality effect' was only shown for the utilisation of mental health professionals, and not regarding utilisation and perceived helpfulness for pharmacological treatments. SES had no significant association with utilisation with taking prescribed medication in HICs, while in LMICs, the reversed social gradient was shown for utilisation. In LMICs, richer and more educated individuals were less likely to take prescribed medication when affected by anxiety or depression. Different explanations for these effects can be considered. First, antidepressant medication tends to be cheaper and easier to access for both healthcare\\n\\nproviders than specialist care and talking therapy 5,28 . Therefore, income might not be an important determinant for medication. Relatedly, medication is often prescribed by primary health care professionals 29 which is - opposed to specialist care - is more frequently used by lower SES individuals 26 . As a second potential explanation, the item to measure treatment utilisation might have been interpreted differently across countries. As the survey item did not specify what type of prescribed medication was taken, the types of pharmacological treatment might differ between HICs and LMICs. As in LMICs, depression and anxiety are particularly strongly underdiagnosed, people reporting with CMD symptoms might be treated for their somatic symptoms  30 . In such cases, higher SES individuals might be less likely to take such potentially unsuitable medication. Future research needs to differentiate between the specific types of treatment and find explanations for the different socio-economic effects.\\n\\nBesides stigma perceptions, trust in healthcare professionals was identified as predictors for treatment utilisation. Especially with the sensitive topic of mental health, trust is an important condition to disclose personal problems and seek help 18 . This finding highlights the importance to increase trust between patients and healthcare providers. Interestingly, stigma and trust were also associated with perceived helpfulness of both treatment types. Thus, treatment helpfulness might be influenced by psychological factors that shape expectations and interactions during the treatment. Conversely, a successful therapy might influence perceptions of stigma and trust. Future research should attempt to disentangle these two alternative causal pathways.\\n\\nThis paper extents previous findings on national-level treatment variation in Europe 5,7 and shows that GDP and health expenditure are important predictors of treatment utilisation globally. The richer a country, the more likely are its citizens to access mental health specialists. However, health expenditure and GDP do not explain cross-national variations in the use of medication in this study. As highlighted earlier, this might be because providing\\n\\nand using medication requires fewer country-level financial resources than providing specialist mental healthcare. Surprisingly, higher GDP is negatively associated with perceived treatment helpfulness of both types of treatment. Based on H3, we expected that higher country-level economic resources would entail with higher service availability and quality of care, and therefore relate to higher treatment satisfaction. Previous findings also indicate that antidepressant treatments were perceived as more helpful in LMICs than HICs 21 . Possibly, richer countries might have higher expectations in treatment helpfulness which are harder to fulfil. This effect should be thoroughly investigated in future international research.\\n\\nSeveral limitations should be highlighted. First, the study uses cross-sectional data and memory recall for lifetime events, which make the results prone to response biases. Second, the data collection during Covid-19 might have changed the salience of mental health related topics. Third, the item to measure lifetime experience of anxiety or depression was designed to allow international comparisons of lifetime experiences, but not clinically precise measurement. No distinction between anxiety and depression can be drawn as they are measured in one item. Forth, differences in the meaning for \\\"talking to mental health professional\\\" and 'taking medication prescribed by a healthcare professional' leave some uncertainty around the results as highlighted in the discussion. Future research should use longitudinal designs and distinctive measures for anxiety, depression, and treatment types to validate our findings.\\n\\n\",\n          \"## Introduction\\n\\n\\nThere is consistent evidence that the neighborhood children grow up in has a causal effect on school achievement and other life chances (e.g., Burdick-Will et al., 2011; Chetty &amp; Hendren, 2018; Chyn &amp; Katz, 2021; 2019; Wodtke, Harding, &amp; Elwert, 2011). Moreover, while much of the neighborhood literature has focused on exposure in adolescence, there is increasing evidence that exposure during the first decade of life also plays a significant role (Donnelly et al., 2017; Leventhal, 2018). For example, after reanalyzing the Moving to Opportunity data, Chetty et al. (2016) found that moving during childhood to a neighborhood with less poverty had positive effects  on  future  economic  outcomes,  while  moving  during  adolescence  had  none  or  even negative effects. Similarly, using neighborhood moves caused by housing demolition, Chyn (2018) found longterm effects when this happened early in children's lives. However, while these and other experimental and quasi-experimental studies have provided strong support for causality, they have come at the expense of more nuanced perspectives on heterogeneity in neighborhood effects (Sharkey &amp; Faber, 2014a).\\n\\nFew st udies examine whether neighborhoods affect children's development differently despite strong reasons for expecting such heterogeneity. Scholars from various disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, economics, and quantitative genetics, have all argued that neighborhoods affect different individuals in different ways as a function of their individual and family characteristics (Belsky et al., 2018; Chyn &amp; Katz, 2021; Galster, 2012; Harding, Gennetian, Winship,  Sanbonmatsu, &amp; Kling,  2011;  Leventhal,  Dup\\u00e9r\\u00e9,  &amp;  A.  Shuey,  2015;  Levy,  Owens,  &amp; Sampson, 2019; Sharkey &amp; Faber, 2014b). Hence, these scholars point to one of the paths forward for studying the effects of neighborhoods: to understand for whom neighborhoods matter.\\n\\nWhile  research  on  heterogeneity  in  sociology  and  economics  has  only  recently  gained traction (Levy, 2022), there is at least some convergence across disciplines in conceptions on how to define the for whom question, that is, what is the child- and family characteristics with which neighborhood effects should be expected to vary. Gender and family socioeconomic resources are key candidates. Moreover, individual biological and psychological vulnerability and resources, like  genetics,  have  also  been  hypothesized  to  differentiate  how  children  are  affected  by neighborhood socioeconomic conditions (e.g., Leventhal et al., 2015; Sharkey &amp; Faber, 2014b), known as 'gene environment interaction' in psychology and behavioral genetics -(Plomin, DeFries, &amp; Loehlin, 1977).\\n\\nIn this paper, we take a novel approach to studying heterogeneity in neighborhood effects by integrating population-wide data from national registries with genetic data from a large health survey.  Moreover,  we  use  a  state-of-the-art  approach  to  tackle  the  endemic  selection  into neighborhoods  by  incorporating  the  Neighborhood  Choice  model,  recently  developed  by  van Ham, Boschman, and Vogel (2018), as well as studying the effects of randomly occurring genetic variation  within  families. Specifically, we  examine  whether  the  impact  of  neighborhood socioeconomics on children's 5 th -grade test scores in reading and math depends on gender, family socioeconomics, and within-family genetics. Our registry data include information on each child's family income, parental education, migrant background, and test scores, as well as aggregate information  on  a  wide  range  of  socioeconomic  (SES)  characteristics  of  their  immediate neighborhoods. In the subset of analyses including genetics, we have coupled the population data with genetic data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) (70,000 parent-offspring  trios),  using  the  Educational  Attainment  Polygenic  Index  (EA4-PGI),  which measures  the  individual  child 's and  their  parents' load  for  genetic  variants  correlated  with educational attainment.\\n\\nWe find an overall effect of neighborhood SES on children's test scores, with a magnitude in the range of other studies (one SD difference in neighborhood SES is, on average, associated with about 6% of an SD higher test scores in our preferred model). Moreover, our main finding is considerable heterogeneity in these effects: boys are twice as affected by neighborhood SES as are girls, and children with lower SES backgrounds are more affected than children of higher SES backgrounds. Additionally, the neighborhood effects are stronger for children with a lower load for genetic variants correlated with educational attainment.\\n\\n\\n## Heterogeneous Effects of Neighborhoods: Theory and Evidence\\n\\n\\nIndividual  development  is  often  considered  to  be  embedded  in  the  wider  ecology  of neighborhoods,  where  individual  characteristics  and  biological  predispositions  interact  with developmental contexts (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Harding et al., 2011; Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Leventhal et al., 2015). From this perspective, the child's developmental outcomes should be considered as a function of individual vulnerabilities and strengths within the characteristics of the neighborhood they live in. Concerning the effects of neighborhood socioeconomics, this is expected  to  interact  with  both  risk  and  protective  factors  in  the  family  and  the  individual (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000). More specifically, Harding et al. (2011) argue that families and individuals differ in their susceptibility to risks in the neighborhood and their ability to benefit from  opportunities.  As  a  supplementary  perspective,  developmental  psychologists  have  also discussed  how  developmental  risk  and  resilience  in  the  family  and  for  the  individual  may contribute to heterogeneity in neighborhood effects (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Leventhal et al., 2015; Leventhal, 2018).\\n\\n\\n## Heterogenous Effects Across Families\\n\\n\\nFamilies  may  have  different  resources -financially  or  human  capital-wise -to  protect their children from  negative  influences  or  to take advantage  of  opportunities  in  their neighborhoods.  For  example,  compound  disadvantage theories  (e.g.,  Jencks  &amp; Mayer,  1990a) suggest that a lack of family resources makes children more receptive to negative neighborhood influences  because  the  family  lacks  the  capacity  to  insulate  their  children  from  exposure  to neighborhood  risks.  For  instance,  wealthier  families  have  the  resources  to  seek  out  more supportive  environments  (e.g.,  leisure  activities)  for  their  children  outside  of  the  immediate neighborhood, which could reduce the negative impact of growing up in disadvantaged areas for this group (see Wodtke, Elwert, &amp; Harding, 2016 for an updated review). In contrast, a lack of family  resources  may  prevent  children  from  being  able  to  take  advantage  of  developmental opportunities in their neighborhoods, particularly if they are more advantaged (Galster, 2012; Jencks &amp; Mayer, 1990b; Wodtke et al., 2016).\\n\\nAnother  perspective  of  SES  differences  builds  upon  relative  deprivation  theory.  Social contrast perspectives argue that students compare themselves to the relevant reference group, which  in  this  case  is  their  neighbors  (Crosnoe,  2009;  Marsh,  1987).  Thus,  children  of  low socioeconomic backgrounds who grow up in affluent areas may experience feelings of inferiority, shame,  and  dissatisfaction,  which  may  negatively  impact  their  development  and  well-being, thereby counteract some of the positive effects of the  affluent neighborhoods, such as highquality schools (DeAngelis, 2021; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2017).\\n\\nAlthough  some  regard  socioeconomic  background  as  a  univariate  concept,  it  is  more common to consider it multidimensional (Bukodi &amp; Goldthorpe, 2013; Mastekaasa &amp; Birkelund, 2022;  Thaning,  2021).   Moreover,  different  socioeconomic  dimensions  may  moderate  the 1 neighborhood effects. For example, Duncan and Magnuson (2003) have argued that income and education  may  affect  outcomes  through  distinct  mechanisms.  Parental  income  may  affect developmental outcomes through the capacity to invest in activities and educational opportunities both within and outside the neighborhood, as well as parental stress and parenting styles  (e.g.,  Yoshikawa,  Aber,  Bergman,  &amp;  Beardslee,  2012).  The  mechanisms  through  which parental education -seen as a measure of human capital -affects developmental outcomes may be through the home learning environment, educational aspirations, and conversational styles (Magnuson, 2007). These mechanisms may also include parent s' capacity to man euver within the neighborhood's con traints and opportunities to facilitate their child's development and well s -being, as well as their local network and (to some extent) hence the child's peers (Harding et al., 2011; Levy, 2022).\\n\\nA  few  studies  have  examined  whether  the  effects  of  neighborhood  socioeconomic conditions vary as a function of parental income and education. In nationwide US data, Wodtke et al. (2016) found that neighborhood disadvantage during adolescence had a stronger impact on\\n\\nhigh school graduation for adolescents from lower-income families, and more so than exposure during childhood. Similarly, Levy et al. (2019) found neighborhood disadvantage in Chicago to be strongly associated with lower attainment of a bachelor's degree, but only for blacks and Latinos, with  no  effect  for  whites.  In  Norway,  Borgen  and  Zachrisson  (2023)  found  that  8 th grade standardized tests  of  children  from  less  educated  and  affluent  families  are  more  affected  by neighborhood disadvantage than their more privileged peers. These studies support a compound disadvantage theory.\\n\\n\\n## Heterogenous Effects Across Children\\n\\n\\nA basic tenet in developmental psychology is that children's individual differences shape development within the wider ecological context (Overton &amp; Molenaar, 2015). Gender has been one key marker of individual differences in neighborhood research. The neighborhood context constitutes  a  source  of  socialization,  with  the  socialization  processes  depending  on  gender (Harding, 2009). Because boys are expected to receive less parental monitoring, they are more exposed  to  influences  from  outside  of  the  family.  Thus,  boys  should  be  more  sensitive  to neighborhood influences than girls (Leventhal et al., 2015). Specifically addressing educational achievement,  Leventhal  et  al.  (2009)  review  nonexperimental  studies  and  conclude  that achievement for boys is more affected by neighborhood characteristics than for girls.\\n\\nHowever,  experimental  and  quasi-experimental  studies  find  the  opposite  pattern. Analyses of the Moving To Opportunity (MTO) experiment showed positive effects on educational outcomes for girls but not for boys (Kling, Liebman, &amp; Katz, 2007).  A subsequent investigation explained this through girls' better ability to adapt to neighborhood norms and navigate the new neighborhood (Clampet-Lundquist, Edin, Kling, &amp; Duncan, 2011). Supporting the notion that girls benefit  more  than  boys  from  moving  away  from  highly  disadvantaged  neighborhoods,  Chyn (2018) mainly found positive effects on future incomes among girls. However, these findings may not be generalizable to the wider context of neighborhood influences, as they stem from children moving from extremely disadvantaged neighborhoods to (at least somewhat) more affluent ones (Chyn  &amp;  Katz,  2021).  In  sum,  the  current  literature  is  inconsistent  with  regard  to  gender differences in neighborhood effects.\\n\\nClassical  neighborhood  research  rarely  theoretisize  nor  empirically  studies  whether neighborhood effects vary based on individual susceptibility or genetic background (Sharkey &amp; Faber,  2014a).  However,  social  sciences  studies  covering  various  topics  are  increasingly incorporating genetic data (Mills &amp; Tropf, 2020), and there is a long research tradition examining gene-environment interactions. Gene-environment interactions have traditionally been studied indirectly  using  twin  methods,  but  more  recently  using  polygenic  indices,  which  measure individual-level propensity to a trait using DNA data (Plomin &amp; Viding, 2022).\\n\\nOf the various theoretical gene-environment models, the literature often tests the notion that  disadvantaged  environments,  as  opposed  to  more  advantaged  ones,  suppress  genetic influences. Most  famously, Sandra Scarr argued that genetic factors largely explained developmental  outcomes  within  the  normal  range  of  environments,  while  in  extremely disadvantaged  environments,  genes  mattered  less  (Scarr-Salapatek,  1971).  More  generally, positive  environments  are  seen  as  an  enhancement  that  accentuates  advantageous  genetic predispositions (Shanahan &amp; Hofer, 2005). From the neighborhood perspective, this would imply that neighborhoods matter more for children with high genetic potential for education.\\n\\nHowever,  other  theoretical  models  lead  to  contrasting  hypotheses,  suggesting  that neighborhood  disadvantage  activates  negative  genetic  predispositions.  For example,  the diathesis-stress model proposes that some individuals have a genetic makeup that increases their risk  of  adverse  outcomes  in  unfavorable  environments.  In  contrast,  others,  less  genetically vulnerable individuals, are less affected (Boardman et al., 2014). The same predictions can be made  based  on  the  compensatory  advantage  model  (Bernardi,  2014).  Based  on  these perspectives, we may expect that children with genetic vulnerabilities for low achievement are most affected by growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\\n\\nThe gene-environment interaction literature has mainly focused on parental socioeconomic status (e.g., Baier &amp; Lang, 2019; Erola, Lehti, Baier, &amp; Karhula, 2021; Ghirardi, GilHern\\u00e1ndez, Bernardi, van Bergen, &amp; Demange, 2023; Isungset et al., 2021; Ruks, 2022) and, to a somewhat lesser extent, school characteristics (Cheesman et al., 2022a; Cheesman et al., 2022b; Stienstra, Knigge, &amp; Maas, 2024; Trejo et al., 2018). The results vary between contexts, with little evidence from family SES-gene interactions in Europe (Baier et al., 2022; Tucker-Drob &amp; Bates, 2016).\\n\\nLess is known about how neighborhoods and genetic potential for education interact. One study by Silva, Wolfram, and Tropf (2023) used the National Child Development Study from the United Kingdom to examine neighborhood-by-gene interaction for individuals born in the same week in 1958, which was followed up to the late 1970s. They found that after holding school SES constant, the gap between individuals with high and low scores on the educational attainment PGI was smaller in socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods than in less advantaged ones.\\n\\nHowever, the interaction between genetic predispositions and school SES was in the opposite direction, suggesting that attending a school with high SES enhances genetic differences.\\n\\nAdditionally, one Norwegian study, using partly the same genetic data as ours, showed that the effects of polygenic index for educational attainment varied at the school but not at the neighborhood level (Cheesman et al., 2022a). However, that study used multilevel models to estimate the total effects of social context and looked at neighborhood effects net of any school effects, in a context where children predominantly attend local schools. In contrast, we consider any school effects, including gene-environment interactions, as part of the total neighborhood effect (Wodtke &amp; Parbst, 2017). Moreover, since the previous Norwegian study, the number of genotyped individuals has more than doubled, which reduces the risk of erroneously concluding that there is no gene-environment interaction.\\n\\n\\n## The Norwegian Context\\n\\n\\nAlthough wealth inequality is comparably high (Hansen &amp; Toft, 2021; Pfeffer &amp; Waitkus, 2021), Norway is often considered a relatively egalitarian country, with low levels of income inequality, redistributive welfare state institutions, and high rates of intergenerational mobility. Moreover, in relative terms, economic segregation is low in Norway (Musterd, 2005). However, there are tendencies toward increasing segregation patterns (Markussen &amp; Roed, 2018; Wessel, 2016), and a  considerable  proportion of  individuals are  continuously  exposed  to either dense poverty or dense affluent areas, especially in large urban areas (Toft, 2018).\\n\\nThere  is  considerable  variation  in  neighborhood  characteristics  in  our  data  (the  data section provides details about variable construction). For example, as shown in Figure 1, looking at Norway as a whole, 1% of children live in neighborhoods where 17% of adults are on social welfare, compared to nearly none on welfare in the most advantaged neighborhood. Likewise, among the most disadvantaged communities, nearly 70% have low education, compared to less than 10% in the most advantaged areas.\\n\\nFigure 1: Distribution of neighborhood characteristics in Norwegian data.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nNote: Details of variables are provided in the data section. Each variable is divided into 100 equal pieces, and the mean is calculated within each piece. This graph shows 4 of 9 neighborhood characteristics studied; Appendix Figure A3 shows the distribution for all neighborhood variables used in this paper.\\n\\nSome earlier studies have examined neighborhood effects in Norway. 2  Using sibling fixed effects, Markussen and Roed (2018) found that neighborhood socioeconomic composition has a\\n\\nhump-shaped impact on grade point average at age 15-16, suggesting that children growing up in medium-ranked neighborhoods had the best outcomes. Moreover, they found that girls were more affected than boys and that low-income children were unaffected by the neighborhood. However,  unlike  standardized  tests,  teacher-assessed  grades  are  influenced  by  within-school grading on a curve, which may inflate (deflate) grades in areas with many low (high) achieving students (Borgen, Borgen, &amp; Birkelund, 2023; Calsamiglia &amp; Loviglio, 2019). Norwegian studies examining standardized test scores have not found a hump-shaped pattern. Rather, they find a negative effect on attending disadvantaged neighborhoods, with stronger neighborhood effects for boys and children from less educated and affluent families (Borgen &amp; Zachrisson, 2023) and lower neighborhood effects for children of non-western immigrant groups than natives (Borgen, Borgen, &amp; Zachrisson, 2024).\\n\\nOther  studies  have  focused  on  Oslo,  the  capital  of  Norway,  where  neighborhood segregation  is  most  pronounced  (Hern\\u00e6s,  Markussen,  &amp;  R\\u00f8ed,  2020),  using  more  traditional covariate  adjustment  strategies.  Brattbakk  and  Wessel  (2013)  found  a  small  influence  of neighborhood  deprivation  during  adolescence  on  later  education,  income,  and  employment. Concerning affluent neighborhoods, Toft and Ljunggren (2016) found that living in upper-class neighborhoods during adolescence was associated with a higher likelihood of attending higher education and gaining upper-class membership, especially for working-class youth.\\n\\n\\n## Data and Variables\\n\\n\\nWe use Norwegian register data covering individuals born in Norway between 1997 and 2008 (approx. 650,000 children), 3 which are matched with genetic data on parents and children from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) (approx. 62,000 children). Neighborhood  units  are  defined  based  on  Statistic  Norway's  detailed  'Basic  Statistical  Unit' classification, which are stable geographical units designed to resemble genuine neighborhoods and are relatively homogeneous concerning location and type of housing. There are about 14,700 neighborhood units in Norway, with about 350 individuals in each unit.\\n\\nWe  measure  the  socioeconomic  composition  in  these  neighborhood  units  using  all individuals born between 30 and 60, including non-parents, separately for each year. First, we calculate  the  neighborhood  characteristics  using  the  following  indicators:  percent  on  social welfare,  percent  on  a  disability  pension,  percent  receiving  housing  allowance,  percent higher educated,  percent  school  dropout  (non-completion  of  upper  secondary  education),  percent among top 10% income, percent among bottom 10% income, average earnings rank. Second, we calculate  the  children's  average  neighborhood  characteristics  when  aged  1 -10.  Third,  we  use principal component  analysis with these SES indicators to produce  our socioeconomic neighborhood  disadvantage  variable  (mean=0  and  standard  deviation=1).  As  expected,  the socioeconomic neighborhood indicators are correlated (Appendix Table A1). Moreover, using the separate indicators in place of the principal component score produces similar estimates, as does taking a simple average of the indicators (Appendix Figure A1).\\n\\nWe use the average of standardized national 5 th -grade tests in reading (Norwegian) and mathematics as the primary outcome variable, which are compulsory tests designed to capture the  full  range  of  subject  skills  among  5 th -graders.  Test  development  is  commissioned  by  the Directorate of Education and Training and carried out by subject experts at universities in Norway along with psychometric experts in the Directorate. About 96% of all students in Norway take the standardized test; students with special needs and those following introductory language courses may be exempt.\\n\\nGenetic variables are from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort (MoBa) Study (Magnus et al., 2006). MoBa is a population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants were recruited from all over Norway from 19992008. The women consented to participation in 41% of the pregnancies. The cohort includes approximately 114.500 children, 95.200 mothers, and 75.200 fathers. The establishment of MoBa and initial data collection was based on a license from the Norwegian Data Protection Agency and approval  from  The  Regional  Committees  for  Medical  and  Health  Research  Ethics.  The  MoBa cohort  is  currently  regulated  by  the  Norwegian  Health  Registry  Act.  The  current  study  was approved  by  The  Regional  Committees  for  Medical  and  Health  Research  Ethics  (project  # 2017/2205).\\n\\nAll women giving birth in Norway from 1999 to 2008 in hospitals and birth units with more than 100 births annually were invited to participate in MoBa, and we have access to data from children born between 2002 and 2008. For the present study, MoBa was linked (through person identification numbers) with Norwegian administrative records provided by Statistics Norway. We have access to genetic data for about 16% of the full birth cohorts, ranging from 10% among the\\n\\n2002 cohort to 19% in the 2006 cohort (Appendix Figure A4). Appendix Table A4 shows the sample characteristics of children included in MoBa compared to those born in Norway. This appendix table  shows  that  families  with  lower  income  and  education  levels,  and  those  residing  in socioeconomically  deprived  areas,  are  underrepresented  in  MoBa.  However,  the  bivariate associations between independent and outcome variables are similar in the MoBa sample and the comparable  full population (Appendix Table A5). Thus, although there is a slight overrepresentation of middle-class families in the MoBa, the similarity of associations suggests that selection into the MoBa sample does not bias associations.\\n\\nGenetic analyses were conducted on a subsample of parent-offspring trios with complete data for genome-wide genotyping. Online Appendix B describes our quality control of the MoBa genetics data. We generated EA4-PGI for all 207,283 parents and children in MoBa who passed the quality control, based on genome-wide association summary statistics excluding 23andMe and MoBa samples. We used the PRSice software to calculate scores using all SNPs (i.e., p-value threshold of 1), with clumping parameters kb=500, p=1, r2=.25. We computed mid-parental PGI by taking the average maternal and paternal PGI. PGI for children from independent families and mid-parental PGI (hereafter 'parental PGI ') w as then centered to have mean zero and standard deviation one. In all gene-environment analyses, we included parental PGI as controls, such that the effects of offspring PGI are within-family direct genetic effects (further described below).\\n\\nRegister-based control variables include a dummy for being girl (=1), dummies for year of birth, a dummy for having an immigrant background (at least one foreign-born parent), quadratic functions of parental earnings rank (at child age six, separate for father and mother), dummies for parents receiving welfare benefits (age six, separate for father and mother), housing benefits\\n\\n(age six, separate for father and mother), unemployment benefits (age six, separate for father and mother), and disability pension (age six, separate for father and mother), and dummies for educational level (9 dummies, separate for father and mother).\\n\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n\\nUnobserved confounding has been a concern in the neighborhood literature for decades (Mayer &amp; Jencks, 1989). The main threat has been that families sort into affluent neighborhoods based on characteristics that also positively influence children's learning (Chyn &amp; Katz, 2021). We use the recently developed two-step Neighborhood Choice model to solve this challenge to causal inference (Schachner &amp; Sampson, 2020; van Ham et al., 2018) under an assumption of selection on  observables  (Morgan  &amp;  Winship,  2015,  pp.  79-81).  This  modeling  approach  first  creates correction terms that measure families' propensity to sort into particular neighborhoods and then controls  for  these  correction  terms  in  a  linear  regression  model.  The  following  two  sections explain these two steps.\\n\\n\\n## Neighborhood Choice Model\\n\\n\\nThe  neighborhood  choice  model  is  based  on  the  idea  that  a  family  with  certain (observable)  characteristics  will  choose  to  live  in  a  neighborhood  with  certain  (observable) characteristics  (van  Ham  et  al.,  2018).  By  modeling  this  selection  into  neighborhoods,  it  can subsequently be used to rule out selection bias in the regression model.\\n\\nWe estimate neighborhood correction terms separately for all Norwegian municipalities using a conditional logit model. We have records of all possible census tracts parents may move to each year within each municipality. B ased on the mother's residential moves, we fin d the year of the family's last neighborhood move. T hus, we know which families that change census tracts during our observation period, as well as all available census tracts (within the municipality) to which they can potentially move to. We then estimate the likelihood \\ud835\\udc43 that family \\ud835\\udc56 will select neighborhood \\ud835\\udc57 based on the interaction between  family characteristics ( \\ud835\\udc7f ) and the characteristics of the \\ud835\\udc57 th neighborhood ( \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc57 ) in a within-family model. Family characteristics we include  are parents'  average  age, parents'  average  number  of  kids,  parents'  average  years  of education,  parents'  average  income,  at  least  one  parent  born  abroad,  parents  receive  social welfare,  parents  receive  disability  pension,  parents  receive  housing  allowance,  and  parents receive unemployment benefits.\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nWith  this  model,  we  can  predict  the  probability  that  family \\ud835\\udc56 selects  any  of  the \\ud835\\udc58 neighborhoods based on the family's socioeconomic background. Following van Ham et al. (2018), we  transform  these  predicted  probabilities  into  inverse  Mills  ratios  before  using  principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the predicted probabilities into a fixed set of orthogonally rotated correction terms.\\n\\nBoth  computational  and  substantial  considerations  guide  our  choice  to  estimate  the neighborhood  choice  model  separately  by  the  municipality. With approximately  13,000 neighborhoods  and  440,000  families,  it  is  computationally  unfeasible  to  estimate  selection models for the  entire  country,  as  this  would  mean  estimating  a  conditional  logit  model  on  a sample of 5.7 billion observations. From a more substantive standpoint, we also expect that the relevant choice set considered by parents is primarily within the municipality, especially in large urban municipalities, where the neighborhood sorting is strongest.\\n\\nThe number of within-municipality choice sets differs between municipalities, and so do the corresponding types of neighborhoods that households may sort into. As a result, the number of  correction  terms  is  typically  larger  in  urban  municipalities  with  considerable  variation  in neighborhood characteristics than in more sparsely populated areas. To make sure we use all available information in the correction terms, we replace the remaining correction terms with random  noise  for  municipalities  and,  as  explained  below,  interact  correction  terms  with municipality fixed effects.\\n\\n\\n## Neighborhood Effects Model\\n\\n\\nIn the second step, the correction terms are used in the neighborhood effect model to account for the household's propensity to reside in a certain type of neighborhood. Specifically, we estimate the neighborhood effects by regressing test scores \\ud835\\udc66 on the neighborhood composite ( \\ud835\\udc41 ) and  the  control  variables.  The  control  variables  include  municipality  fixed  effects  ( \\ud835\\udefc ), interactions  between  municipality  fixed  effects  and  the  neighborhood  correction  terms  ( \\ud835\\udefc \\u2217 \\ud835\\udc43\\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc34 ), and some additional individual-level covariates (year of birth, birth month, gender, and in some models, child and parental EA4-PGI):\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n, where   and   index individual and cohort. \\ud835\\udc56 \\ud835\\udc57\\n\\nThe  interactions  between  the  correction  terms  and  the  municipality  fixed  effects constitute an important part of this model. Since we model the neighborhood choice within the separate municipalities, the values of the correction terms cannot be directly compared between municipalities. Including municipality fixed effects and allowing the coefficients of the correction terms to vary by municipality solves this challenge.\\n\\n\\n## Treatment Effect Heterogeneity Models\\n\\n\\nWe examine heterogeneous neighborhood effects using interaction variables. We include neighborhood  interactions  between  neighborhood  disadvantage  and  parental  education, parental earnings rank, gender, and child EA4-PGI:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n, where \\ud835\\udc40\\ud835\\udc56 is shorthand for the separate moderators. This model allows us to check whether, for example,  children  of  low-educated  parents  are  more  strongly  influenced  by  neighborhood characteristics than children of high-educated parents. When estimating the interaction with EA4PGI, we control for parental EA4-PGI. This within-family PGI model controls for the non-random selection of neighborhoods by parents (Cheesman et al., 2022a).\\n\\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics.\\n\\nNote: Correlations=Bivariate correlations between neighborhood and variable.\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n\\n\\n## Average Neighborhood Effects\\n\\n\\nThe neighborhood socioeconomic composition is strongly associated with students' test scores;  a  one  standard  deviation  increase  in  the  neighborhood  disadvantage  composite  is associated with a decrease in national test scores by 21% of a standard deviation (column 1 in Table 2). To contextualize the size of this association, let us compare achievement gaps between the most advantaged and least advantaged neighborhoods with the corresponding gap between wealthy  and  low-income  families.  Figure  2  demonstrates  a  difference  of  about  one  standard deviation  in  test  scores  between  the  most  and  least  affluent  neighborhoods  (1.06  standard deviations), which is close to the achievement gap among children of the richest and poorest parents (about 1.2 standard deviations).\\n\\nFigure 2: Bivariate associations between neighborhood disadvantage and standardized test scores (left) and parental earnings (right).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nAlthough the neighborhood children grow up in is strongly associated with achievement outcomes in childhood, not surprisingly, a large part  of the achievement differences between neighborhoods  are  driven  by  sorting.  Still,  after  accounting  for  sorting  via  the  neighborhood choice model, the neighborhood's socioeconomic composition has a sizeable influence on test scores: a one standard deviation increase in the neighborhood disadvantage composite reduces reading scores by about 5.5% of a standard deviation (column 2 in Table 2).  These results mean 4 that  compared  to  growing  up  in  the  most  advantaged  areas,  growing  up  in  the  most\\n\\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods leads to about 22% of a standard deviation lower achievement (i.e., comparing -2SD with +2SD). Translated into percentile points, this effect size involves moving a student who scores at the median to the 58 th percentile. 5\\n\\nTable 2: Estimated neighborhood effect on national test scores.\\n\\nNote: Standard errors clustered on neighborhood in parentheses. Parental education is centered at 10 years. Model (1) shows the bivariate association between neighborhood disadvantage and test scores, while models (2)-(6) show estimated neighborhood effects using the Neighborhood Selection Model. In models (3)-(6), interactions with gender, parental education, parental earnings, and EA4-PGI is included. These models also controls for the main effects of the variable going into the interaction. Further, model (6) includes controls for parental EA4-PGI.\\n\\n\\n## Heterogeneous Neighborhood Effects\\n\\n\\nThe  neighborhood  effects  differ  considerably  by  individual  and  family  background characteristics, as shown in columns 3-6 in Table 2, with children with lower achievement levels most affected by growing up in a disadvantaged area. First, boys are considerably more affected by the neighborhood than girls; neighborhood SES affects boys' test scores by 6.8% of a standard deviation, compared to 4.1% among girls (column 3).\\n\\nSecond, the test scores of children of disadvantaged parents, as measured by parental education and earnings, are more affected by neighborhood than those of advantaged parents\\n\\n(columns 4-5). The estimated neighborhood effect at different levels of parental education and earnings is presented in Figure 3. Among children of parents who have completed compulsory schools  (9  years  of  education  for  the  parental  cohort),  a  one  standard  deviation  increase  in neighborhood disadvantage reduces test scores by 5.8%, compared to 3.4% among parents with a  master's degree (18  years  of education). Neighborhood effects heterogeneity is even more pronounced by parental earnings; comparing children of parents at the top and bottom of the earnings distribution, there is a difference in neighborhood effects of 7.2% and 0.4%.\\n\\nFigure 3: Estimated neighborhood effects at different levels of child genetics, parental earnings rank, and parental years of education.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nNote: Coefficients are based on the results in Table 2.\\n\\nFinally, children's polygenic index for educational attainment, as measured by EA4-PGI, significantly  moderates  the  neighborhood  effect  (column  6).  The  results  indicate  a  geneenvironment interaction where children with the highest load for genetic variants correlated with educational attainment are unaffected by neighborhood disadvantage.\\n\\n\\n## Robustness\\n\\n\\nThe neighborhood effects are estimated using the neighborhood choice model (Schachner &amp; Sampson, 2020; van Ham et al., 2018). We test the robustness of the results by including genetic controls  and  using  a  covariate  adjustment  strategy.  Table  3  shows  estimated  neighborhood effects using a covariate adjustment strategy, with the full register sample in columns 1 and 2, and the reduced neighborhood choice sample in column 3. The covariate adjustment strategy results  in  a  lower  neighborhood  effect;  a  one  standard  deviation  increase  in  neighborhood disadvantage reduces test scores by 4.7% of a standard deviation in the covariate adjustment model, compared to 5.5% in the neighborhood choice model (compare columns 2 in Table 2 and 3). The results in column 3 show that the neighborhood effects are nearly identical in the full register sample and the sample included in the neighborhood choice model.\\n\\nTable 3: Estimated neighborhood effects using a covariate adjustment strategy.\\n\\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses. Control variables include gender, year of birth, immigrant background, earnings rank, parents receiving welfare benefits, housing benefits, unemployment benefits, and disability pension, and dummies for parental educational level. Estimates in columns (1) and (2) are from the full register data, while the estimate from column (3) is from the sample included in the selection model. + p&lt;0.10, * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001\\n\\nWe also test the robustness of the results by including genetic controls. Because they capture only a small portion of the genetic effects, polygenic indices are better suited to study gene-environment  interactions  than  serving  as  control  variables.  Still,  there  are  clear  genetic sorting patterns in neighborhoods in Norway, as shown by the bivariate correlation in Table 1 and graphically  in  Appendix  Figure  A5.  Moreover,  although  child  and  parental  PGI  only  explain  a quarter of the twin heritability in education (which is ~ 40%), it is nevertheless a strong predictor of test scores compared to other background characteristics. For example, explaining 10% of the variation in test scores, child and parental PGI explains only slightly less than parental education (12.7%), and more than parental earnings rank (7%) (i.e., \\ud835\\udc45 2 in Table A3).\\n\\nThus, if genetic confounding exists, we expect the PGI controls to reduce the estimated neighborhood  effects.  In  Table  4,  columns  2  and  4  replicate  the  selection  and  covariate adjustment model in the MoBa genetics sample. The adjusted neighborhood effects are lower when estimated on the subsample where genetic controls are available (cf. columns 2 in Tables 2 and 3), suggesting some selection into the genetic sample. Additionally, including genetic control variables  reduces  the  estimated  neighborhood  effects  further,  suggesting  that  unobserved genetic confounding could slightly upwardly bias the main neighborhood effects. However, the estimates  are  still  statistically  significant,  and  the  smaller  sample  size  with  the  genetic  data introduces some uncertainty; the 95% confidence intervals with and without the genetic controls overlap.\\n\\nTable 4: Estimated neighborhood effects controlling for parental and child EA4-PGI.\\n\\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses. Only individuals observed in the MoBa genetics are included. Model (1)\\n\\nshows the bivariate association between neighborhood disadvantage and test scores in the MoBa sample, while models (2) and (3) show estimated neighborhood effects using the Neighborhood Selection Model and models (4) and (5) estimated using covariate adjustment model. Covariate adjustment controls are explained in the table note of Table 3. PGI controls in column (3) and (5) include parental and child EA4-PGI.\\n\\n- + p&lt;0.10, * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001\\n\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\n\\nThere is limited research on neighborhood effects on early school outcomes and even less research on for whom neighborhoods matter. Adapting the Neighborhood Choice Model of van Ham et  al.  (2018)  to  the  entire  country  of  Norway,  we  find  that  exposure  to  neighborhood disadvantage during a child's ten first years impacts test scores: compared to growing up in the most affluent areas, the children in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods get about 22% lower test  scores  in  fifth  grade.  Moreover,  we  find  that  boys  are  more  affected  by  neighborhood disadvantage than girls and that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more affected than advantaged groups. Additionally, our findings suggest that children with lower polygenic index for educational attainment are more affected by their neighborhood surroundings than other children.\\n\\nBy finding that neighborhood influences test scores, our study fits with extensive literature that finds that growing up in disadvantaged areas affects student outcomes (Leventhal, 2018;\\n\\nSharkey &amp; Faber, 2014a). To contextualize our findings, let us compare the neighborhood effect to  the  influence  of  parental  earnings  and  education.  Indeed,  the  family  environment  is  more influential than the more distal neighborhoods. Additionally, the family variables operate partly through neighborhood choice, which means that parental education and earnings capture the effects of both neighborhood and family environment. Nevertheless, the size of the estimated neighborhood  effects  is  15-20%  of  the  parental  earnings  and  education  coefficients;  a  one standard deviation increase in parental earnings and education is associated with an increase in test scores by 26.4% and 35.6% of a standard deviation (Appendix Table A3), compared to 5.5% for  neighborhood  disadvantage  score.   Thus,  neighborhoods  have  a  meaningful  influence  on 6 children's test scores.\\n\\nWhile previous studies have provided strong evidence of causality, less is known about how neighborhood effects vary by family background, gender, and individual traits (Levy, 2022; Sharkey &amp; Faber, 2014a). In our results, children of low socioeconomic backgrounds are most negatively  affected  by  growing  up  in  disadvantaged  neighborhoods.  This  finding  fits  with  US research showing more influential neighborhood effects on later-life outcomes for disadvantaged groups (Levy et al., 2019; Wodtke et al., 2016).\\n\\nIt is challenging  to  conclude  why  parental  socioeconomic  background  moderates neighborhood effects. However, one clue may be found in the fact that neighborhood effects vary more  with  parental  earnings  than  parental  education.  Parental  education  and  income  are correlated (Sands\\u00f8r et al., 2021) and are likely to influence the consequences of growing up in\\n\\ndisadvantaged  neighborhoods  for  many  of  the  same  reasons: parents'  capacity  to  maneuver within the neighborho od's constraints and opportunities to facilitate their child's development and  well-being,  home  learning  environment,  and  conversational  styles.  However,  parental earnings  are  a  better  predictor  of  parents   capacity  to  invest  in  activities  and  educational ' opportunities within and outside of the neighborhood, and a better predictor of parental stress.\\n\\nThere  has  been  mixed  evidence  on  whether  boys  are  more  negatively  affected  by neighborhood disadvantage than girls: while moving to opportunity types of studies have found stronger  effects  for  girls  than  boys  (Chyn,  2018;  Kling  et  al.,  2007),  nonexperimental  studies typically found the opposite (Leventhal et al., 2009). Our findings support the latter, suggesting that neighborhood disadvantage affects boys considerably more than girls.\\n\\nMoreover,  it  is  improbable  that  these  neighborhood-by-gender  interaction  effects  are biased.  Although  parents  sort  into  various  neighborhoods  based  on  partly  hard-to-observe personal  characteristics  and  resources,  the  child's  gender  is  independent  of  these  sorting processes; girls and boys are randomly distributed across neighborhoods (in the developmental period we investigate). This randomness essentially eliminates the concern that girls (boys) with specific characteristics are more likely to live in certain neighborhoods, allowing us to estimate the  difference  in  neighborhood  effects  by  gender  credibly.  (For  neighborhood-by-gender interactions to be biased, boy parents must systematically move into different neighborhoods than  girl  parents  based  on  the  treatment  effect.)  Thus,  as  has  been  hypothesized  in  several studies,  the  gendered  processes  involved  when  children  and  youth  move  away  from  highly disadvantaged communities to more affluent ones may, in some ways, differ from the processes involved when growing up in disadvantaged areas (Chyn &amp; Katz, 2021; Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2011).\\n\\nTurning  to  genetic  dispositions,  we  find  that  children's  genetic  propensity  toward education significantly moderates the effect of growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods, with the  strongest  effects  among  children  genetically  likely  to  struggle  in  school.  This  finding contradicts  the  predictions  of  the  Scarr-Rowe  hypothesis  (Scarr-Salapatek,  1971),  where advantaged neighborhoods are assumed to provide the most stimulating environment, allowing children with a high genetic potential for education to express their advantages fully. Instead, our findings support the predictions of the diathesis-stress model, which proposes that genetically vulnerable children are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes in unfavorable environments, while less genetically vulnerable children are less affected (Boardman et al., 2014).\\n\\nFinding  that  neighborhood  effects  vary  by  genetics  is  hardly  surprising,  given  the compelling arguments for gene-environment interactions. Yet, the empirical literature, which has focused mainly on parental socioeconomic status, has been less consistent, especially in Europe (Baier  et  al.,  2022;  Tucker-Drob  &amp;  Bates, 2016).  A  few studies  have  examined gene-by-school interactions using polygenic indices (Cheesman et al., 2022a; Cheesman et al., 2022b; Trejo et al., 2018), but less is known about how neighborhoods and genetic potential for education interact. One exception is an earlier Norwegian study, which, contrary to our study, found that genetic liability for education did not vary at the neighborhood level (Cheesman, 2022). However, our results may differ from that study because it investigated neighborhood effects net of any school effects, and because it had access to a considerably smaller sample of genotyped individuals. 7\\n\\nThe case for the causal interpretation of our genetic neighborhood interactions is solid, although slightly more complicated than for the gender interactions. We use a within-family PGI design where the neighborhood-by-PGI interaction is estimated conditional on parents' PGI. In the  within-family  PGI  design,  the  child  PGI  reflects  the  random  segregation  of  alleles  at conception. The refore, the child's PGI is uncorrelated with the social environment the parents select (Cheesman et al., 2022b), and we can credibly estimate the gene-environment correlation using this within-family PGI design. However, measurement errors in the polygenic index are likely to attenuate the size of the gene-environment interaction (Pingault et al., 2022).\\n\\nTo conclude, using the Neighborhood Choice Model of van Ham et al. (2018), we find that exposure to neighborhood disadvantage during a child's ten first years has a meaningful impact on  5 th -grade  standardized  test  scores.  Moreover,  neighborhood  effects  vary  considerably  by socioeconomic  background,  gender,  and  polygenic  index  for  education,  highlighting  the importance of studying heterogeneous neighborhood effects. This negative effect of neighborhood disadvantage potentially compounds with individual risk (lower load for genetic variants  correlated  with  educational  attainment)  and  family  risk  (lower  family  income  and parental education levels) for underachievement at school, and potentially most strongly so for boys. Hence, our findings suggest that policies designed to improve opportunities and life chances\\n\\nfor these children should also incorporate interventions at the neighborhood level, to reduce neighborhood disadvantage or compensate for the detrimental effect of it.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 345,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This study investigates the inverse relationship between the size and average cost of municipal waste management services, supported by empirical data across different waste quantities and attributed to scale and scope effects, such as increased transition costs with multiple service providers.

The research introduces an original methodology for analyzing waste management service efficiency in urban areas, considering alternative cost measures across various phases, scales, and scopes of municipal waste services.

Using multi-level logistic regression models, the findings reveal a persistent global \\\"triple inequality effect,\\\" whereby lower SES correlates with higher CMD prevalence, reduced likelihood of engaging with mental health professionals, and diminished perceptions of treatment helpfulness, with these disparities moderated by factors such as stigma and trust in health providers. Notably, higher household income is associated with increased treatment engagement and perceived helpfulness, though not with medication use, and country-level health expenditure positively influences treatment utilization. Overall, the results underscore that addressing mental health inequalities requires multifaceted strategies that account for social, psychological, and systemic determinants across different health outcomes and economic contexts.\",\n          \"This study investigates the causal influence of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) on children's fifth-grade test scores, employing population-wide registry data linked with genetic information from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study.
